# Introduction
Check It is a set of Joomla components that can be used to manage libraries.  It
contains both "front end" and "back end" functionality.  More to come later...

At this point in time, there are two ongoing endeavors in the same repository.
The "pre-fork-install" folder has what is used in production and contains many
modifications specifically needed by SSCPS.org.  The other folders are an effort
to change the name and refactor the code-base at the same time.  Not the best
idea, but we're a school and will have staff, students and parents working on
different aspects.

# History
Initially it is a fork of the GPL version of "Book Library" plugin by Ordasoft.
We (SSCPS.org) wanted changes that Ordasoft never responded about making.  So we
decided to fork the project and make our module.
