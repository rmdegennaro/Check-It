It was cold, freezing cold and passers wrapped up in their cloaks of wool and paid no attention to this poorly dressed girl.     She did not sell any matchbox and was too scared to go back home empty-handed because she feared the wrath of her father, she chose to stay the night of New Year's Eve in the snowy streets. To warm up, she scratched her matches one by one. The gentle flame warmed hers fingers numb, but that gave her happiness, it was the vision of the wonders of the holiday season and the appearance of her late grandmother in the firelight ...<br />

These timeless, classic stories have been gloriously illustrated and made accessible for younger children to read alone, or for all the family to enjoy together, as they listen along with the cassette tape. This fresh approach brings the stories and their characters to life. There are also special pages dedicated to background detail, setting the scene of each story.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />"All children, except one, grow up." Thus begins a great classic of children's literature that we all remember as magical. What we tend to forget, because the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland has been so relentlessly boiled down, hashed up, and coated in saccharine, is that J.M. Barrie's original version is also witty, sophisticated, and delightfully odd. The Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, live a very proper middle-class life in Edwardian London, but they also happen to have a Newfoundland for a nurse. The text is full of such throwaway gems as "Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter Pan when she was tidying up her children's minds," and is peppered with deliberately obscure vocabulary including "embonpoint," "quietus," and "pluperfect." Lest we forget, it was written in 1904, a relatively innocent age in which a plot about abducted children must have seemed more safely fanciful. Also, perhaps, it was an age that expected more of its children's books, for <I>Peter Pan</I> has a suppleness, lightness, and intelligence that are "literary" in the best sense. In a typical exchange with the dastardly Captain Hook, Peter Pan describes himself as "youth... joy... a little bird that has broken out of the egg," and the author interjects: "This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form." A book for adult readers-aloud to revel in--and it just might teach young listeners to fly. (Ages 5 and older) <I>--Richard Farr</I> <br />

Full-color illustrations.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />The tale of a little duck alone on the Yangtze River, <I>The Story About Ping</I> is a sweet and funny book with wonderfully rich and colorful illustrations. On a day like any other, Ping sets off from the boat he calls home with his comically large family in search of "pleasant things to eat." On this particular day, he is accidentally left behind when the boat leaves. Undaunted, the little duck heads out onto the Yangtze in search of his family, only to find new friends and adventures--and a bit of peril--around every bend. <P> The exceptional illustrations bring the lush Yangtze to life, from Ping's family to the trained fishing birds he finds himself among to the faithfully rendered boats and fishermen. Certainly intended to be read aloud, <I>The Story About Ping</I> deserves a place on every young reader's (or listener's) shelf. (Picture book)<br />

It is Kitten's first full moon, and when she sees it she thinks it is a bowl of milk in the sky. And she wants it. Does she get it? Well, no . . . and yes. What a night!</p><p>A brief text, large type, and luminescent pictures play second fiddle to the star of this classic picture book—brave, sweet and lucky Kitten! "Henkes's text, reminiscent of Margaret Wise Brown's work in the elemental words, rhythms, and appealing sounds, tells a warm, humorous story that's beautifully extended in his shimmering, gray-toned artwork."—<em>ALA Booklist</em> </p><p>Winner of the Caldecott Medal, an ALA Notable Book, a <em>New York Times</em> Best Illustrated Book, and winner of the Charlotte Zolotow Award</p><p>Supports the Common Core State Standards</p><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />In this beautiful picture book, winner of the 2005 Caldecott Medal, Kevin Henkes, captures the sweet, sometimes slapstick struggle of Kitten, who sees her first full moon and thinks it's a bowl of milk in the sky.<p> Any child who has yearned for anything will understand how much Kitten wants that elusive bowl of milk. Readers will giggle as she tries to lick the faraway moon and gets a bug on her tongue, or leaps to catch it and falls down the stairs. In an effective refrain, the narrator repeats, "Still, there was the little bowl of milk, just waiting." The winning combination here is the simplicity and humor of the story, paired with gorgeous black-and-white illustrations with thick black lines (mirrored by the thick bold sans-serif font) and shades of grey that are as luminous as a moonlit night should be. Full-moon circles and ovals appear throughout the design: white circle full moons on the endpapers, elliptical flowers by the porch, white circles of firefly light, oval pads on Kitten's paws, and her big round eyes (especially when surprised and soaking wet). Children will love Kitten's quest and ensuing comedy of errors, but what they will love even more is that there's an actual bowl of milk waiting on the porch for Kitten.

"Fuzzy goes where I go," said Owen. But Mrs. Tweezers disagreed. She thought Owen was too old for a blanket. Owen disagreed. No matter what Mrs. Tweezers came up with, Blanket Fairies or vinegar, Owen had the answer. But when school started, Owen't mother knew just what to do, and everyone -- Owen, Fuzzy, and even Mrs. Tweezers -- was happy. </p><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />The clinical name is <i>transitional object</i>, but for young children, a beloved blanket is more like  a lifeline. And that's exactly how Owen feels about his baby blanket, fondly named Fuzzy. The Owen-Fuzzy  relationship is cruising along smoothly until a nosy neighbor, Mrs. Tweezers, leans over the fence and asks  his parents, "Isn't he getting a little old to be carrying that thing around?" With kindergarten just around the  corner, Owen's parents wonder if he should in fact relinquish his prized Fuzzy. Kevin Henkes uses his  signature mouse characters and jewel-tone watercolors to explore the antics and foils of one mouse-boy, one  rag-blanket, and two parents wondering how to help their son kick the habit. This is what Henkes does best--playfully bringing childhood fears and feelings to the surface while portraying real-life parent-child  tensions. Mrs. Tweezers, a real sourpuss, is no help at all. She offers terrible over-the-fence advice, such as  dipping Fuzzy in vinegar (as if to cure a nail-biting habit) or stealing the blanket in the night.  <P> It is not until the eve of Owen's first day of kindergarten that his mother hatches the perfect solution.  Ultimately, she finds a way that Owen can hang on to his first true love while also taking the next step into  middle childhood--a solution that suits everyone, including Mrs. Tweezers.

What could be more perfect for an author/illustrator who has continually stripped away the mystique of architectural structures that have long fascinated modern man? With typical zest and wry sense of humor punctuating his drawings, David Macaulay traces the step-by-step planning and construction of both castle and town.</DIV><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Imagine yourself in 13th-century England. King Edward I has just named the fictitious Kevin le Strange to be the Lord of Aberwyvern--"a rich but rebellious area of Northwest Wales." Lord Kevin's first task is to oversee the construction of a strategically placed castle and town in order to assure that England can "dominate the Welsh once and for all." And a story is born! In the Caldecott Honor Book <I>Castle</I>, David Macaulay--author, illustrator, former architect and teacher--sets his sights on the creation and destiny of Lord Kevin's magnificent castle perched on a bluff overlooking the sea. Brick by brick, tool by tool, worker by worker, we witness the methodical construction of a castle through exquisitely detailed pen-and-ink illustrations. Children who love to know how things work especially appreciate Macaulay's passion for process and engineering. Moats, arrow loops, plumbing, dungeons, and weaponry are all explained in satisfying detail. This talented author also has a keen sense of irony and tragedy, which is played out in the intricacies of the human story: a castle can be built as a fortress, but ultimately it becomes obsolete when humans discover that cooperation works best.

Only Laura Numeroff and Felicia Bond could make school this much fun!</p><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Ah, mice. Give them an inch and they'll take a mile. Laura Numeroff and  illustrator Felicia Bond, creators of the bestselling picture books <I>If You Give a Mouse a Cookie</I>  and <I>If You Take a Mouse to the  Movies</I>, are back with <I>If You Take a Mouse to School</I>. As you might  imagine, there are great risks in bringing your mouse to school. For starters,  he'll ask you for your lunchbox. And then a sandwich. And a snack for later.  Still not satisfied, he'll want to participate in everything from math to  soccer. Children and adults alike will revel in the hilarious, very cute  illustrations of the mouse in the classroom: hanging from the top corner of the  blackboard to spell (aptly enough) "precocious" and "adrenaline," writing  "'Goodnight Mouse' by Mouse," sitting inside the boy's open backpack playing  with a yo-yo, etc. This book is more episodic in nature than the truly  cause-and-effect formula of the previous books: "If you give a pig a pancake,  she'll want some syrup to go with it." Nonetheless, kids who know and love this  rollicking read-aloud series will laugh and play to see a mouse at school. (Ages  4 to 8) <I>--Karin Snelson</I><br />

A literal-minded housekeeper causes a ruckus in the household when she attempts to make sense of some instructions.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Amelia Bedelia is a housekeeper who takes her instructions quite  literally. Reading the list of chores that her employer has left her, Amelia begins with "Dust the furniture." How odd, Amelia thinks to herself. "At my house we undust the furniture." Nonetheless, she dutifully locates the "Dusting Powder" in the bathroom, and proceeds to sprinkle it all over the living-room furniture and floor. Next she is asked to "Draw the drapes when the sun comes in." So of course, Amelia sits down with a sketchpad and gives it her best shot. Children love reading about the antics of silly Amelia Bedelia for myriad reasons. It's an  early reader book, so children in primary grades can take satisfaction in reading the book on their own. But, even more thrilling, children who are 6 and older can successfully interpret the figurative meaning behind most adult idioms. Being told to "keep an eye on the cat," for example, might compel some preschoolers to stick their eyeballs on a cat's face, eliciting peals of laughter from know-it-all grownups. But older children know better, and they love the fact that they know better. Young readers will find this bumblingly charming, eager-to-please housekeeper as irresistible as Amelia Bedelia's employers do. (Ages 6 and older) <I>--Gail Hudson</I><br />

Romance? Literary instruction? <I>Go, Dog. Go!</I> offers all this and more, wrapped up in one simply worded, warmly hued package. Using single-syllable words in rhythmic repetition, and introducing colors and prepositions, this Seuss-styled classic has been an early favorite of children since 1961. For those looking for deeper meaning in a beginning reader book, here you'll find nothing less than a microcosm of life. Green dogs, yellow dogs, big dogs, little dogs. Dogs who prefer cars, dogs who favor skis. All represent the diversity a child will find in the world. And the slow-to-bud romance between the cheerfully oblivious yellow dog and the mincing pink poodle explains more succinctly than most self-help books what goes on in many grown-up relationships. Nonetheless, Eastman takes the concept of "primary" to heart, with his simple silly phrases and solidly colored illustrations. Not only will this book inspire peals of laughter in kids, it will also help them make the magical connection between those mysterious black squiggles on the page, and the words they hear and speak. <I>(Ages 4 to 8)</I><br />

Another young, funny book perfect for reading aloud.<br><br>One day down on the farm, Duck got a wild idea.  "I bet I could ride a bike," he thought.  He waddled over to where the boy parked his bike, climbed on and began to ride.  At first he rode slowly and he wobbled a lot, but it was fun! Duck rode past Cow and waved to her.  "Hello, Cow!" said Duck. "Moo," said Cow. But what she thought was, "A duck on a bike? That's the silliest thing I've ever seen!"<br>And so Duck rides past sheep, horse, and all the other barnyard animals. Suddenly, a group of kids ride by on their bikes and run into the farmhouse, leaving the bikes outside. Now ALL the animals can ride bikes, just like Duck!</div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />When Duck gets the zany idea to ride a bike one day, each animal on the  farm has a reaction. "M-o-o-o," says Cow. But what she's really thinking is, "A  duck on a bike? That's the silliest thing I've ever seen!" Pig and Pig say  "Oink," thinking all the while, "Duck is such a show-off!" But it's not until a  crew of kids shows up and leaves their bikes lying about that the true feelings  of all the animals come to light, and for one brief, glorious moment, the farm  is a mad, mad world of two-wheeling road hogs (and chickens and horses and  goats). David Shannon, the creator of Caldecott Honor Book, <I>No, David!</I>, fills the pages of  this barnyard romp with sun-soaked color, charming animals, and unusual  perspectives. We see Cat, for example, looming belly-first in the foreground,  with Duck merrily pedaling away in the distance. The story itself is nothing to  write home about--<I>No, David!</I> is far snappier and more original--but  younger kids may well enjoy the repetitive crescendo and the goofy finale.

A peddler walks around selling caps from a tall, tottering pile on his head. Unable to sell a single cap one morning, he walks out into the countryside, sits down under a tree, checks that all the caps are in place, and falls asleep. When he wakes up, the caps are gone--and the tree is full of cap-wearing monkeys. His attempts to get the caps back generate the kind of repetitive rhythm that 3- and 4-year-olds will adore.

To celebrate 100 days in Miss Bindergarten's kindergarten class, all her students bring 100 of something to school.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />From Joseph Slate and illustrator Ashley Wolff, creators of the popular <I>Miss Bindergarten Gets Ready for  Kindergarten</I>, comes this lively celebration of the 100th day of kindergarten. In honor of this festive milestone, each student must bring "100 of some wonderful, one-hundred-full thing!" to school the following day.  That night, we see Adam the alligator making a fort of 100 Popsicle sticks, Brenda the beaver falling asleep over her paper chain of 100 colorful loops, and Christopher the cat lamenting his toppling 100 blocks. Meanwhile, Miss Bindergarten does 100 sit-ups before making 100-day punch (with 100 ice cubes and 100 cherries), painstakingly decorates her classroom, and concocts miscellaneous math-oriented activities. Just before class, "Jessie pokes her polka dots. / Kiki carries tarts. / Lenny hugs a bagful of a hundred candy hearts." The rhyming text bounces through the celebratory preparations of the whole kindergarten class--from Adam the alligator to Zachary the zebra--until the whole class reunites for a party that's perhaps a hundred times more fun than they imagined! Kids will enjoy examining and reexamining the humorous pictures of the animal students battling with various crafts, and they'll adore the loving and purposeful Miss Bindergarten--a Border collie with a heart of gold... and 100 bows on her dress.

But in this book, the youngsters are a wide variety of dinosaurs. And how do dinosaurs say good night?<br><br>Filled with wonderful detail and humor, children and their parents will love the expressions and antics of the eleven different dinosaur children depicted here, and each species is spelled out somewhere in the young dinosaur's bedroom. In the end, young dinosaurs behave a lot like people do: They give a big kiss, turn out the light, tuck in their tails, and whisper "good night."<br></div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />"How does a dinosaur say good night when Papa comes in to turn off the light? Does a dinosaur slam his tail and pout? Does he throw his teddy bear all about? Does a dinosaur stomp his feet on the floor and shout: 'I want to hear one book more!'? DOES A DINOSAUR ROAR?" Most certainly not. Dinosaurs give their mommies and daddies big hugs and kisses, tuck their tales in, and whisper "Good night!"<p> Every sleepy little dinosaur will recognize the tricks of the trade in these bedtime shenanigans. The chuckle factor is sky-high here, with giant, full-page pictures of cleverly identified <I>Tyrannosaurus rexes</I>, triceratopses, and <I>Pteranodons</I>. A variety of human mothers and fathers trying to put their dinosaur children to bed will bring the point home that the story may have something to do with <I>human</I> kid behavior as well. This good-natured nighttime book is sure to be a winner (even though it might inspire a few noisy dinosaur antics), especially as it's written by Jane Yolen, prolific Caldecott Medalist author of <I>Owl Moon</I>. Yolen and Mark Teague have teamed up to create a fun, silly, playful read-aloud. (Ages 3 to 7) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I><br />

To his amazement, Christmas comes anyway, and the Grinch discovers the true meaning of the holiday.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />"The Grinch <I>hated</I> Christmas! The whole Christmas season! / Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason." Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time. For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His "wonderful, awful" idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.<p> Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing, but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant, twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos, the transcendent nature of joy, and of course, the growth potential of a heart that's two sizes too small. This holiday classic is perfect for reading aloud to your favorite little Whos. <I>(Ages 4 to 8)</I><br />

Some surprises are still in store, even for Madeline. <p> While sorting through his grandfather's files, artist and writer John Bemelmans Marciano discovered the manuscript and pencil sketches for this last  of the much-loved Madeline series. With great respect, Marciano completed the project with full-color paintings, and added two more of Bemelmans's holiday classics--"The Count and the Cobbler" and "Sunshine"--to create a collection no Bemelmans and Madeline devotee can do without.

There are giant porcupines and leaping llamas, lizards that dance the cancan and even kissing fishes! As the animal antics grow sillier, a little boy finds choosing confusing. Just when all hope seems lost, he finds the perfect pet. But what kind of pet does he get? <P>Melrose Cooper's lilting verse and Yumi Heo's fanciful pictures come together to create one rollicking and cacophonous pet show that will be enjoyed over and over again.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />"What pet can I get? What pet can I get? What pet can I get? What pet can I get?" demands the young boy in this quirky, extraordinary, wildly artistic picture book. And indeed, it is hard to choose given this fantastic menagerie of "Kissing pets/Hissing pets/Even tail-missing pets" and "Round pets/Crowned pets/Coiling-around pets." <p> Author Melrose Cooper, who has said that guinea pigs look like "little meat loaves with eyes," concocts delightful, childlike rhymes that collide exquisitely with artist Yumi Heo's fabulously madcap, folk-art-style illustrations. Heo, illustrator of <I>The Rabbit's Judgment</I> and <I>The Rabbit's Escape</I>, creates funny, boldly colorful, flat, dynamic paintings that are akin to the work of <I>New Yorker</I> artist Roz Chast, Lane Smith, and Maira Kalman. Comparisons aside, however, <I>Pets!</I> stands on its own four feet as a uniquely endearing, offbeat tribute to animals of all shapes and sizes, and to the children (and adults) who want them all. <I>(All ages)</I><br />

"Fuzzy goes where I go," said Owen. But Mrs. Tweezers disagreed. She thought Owen was too old for a blanket. Owen disagreed. No matter what Mrs. Tweezers came up with, Blanket Fairies or vinegar, Owen had the answer. But when school started, Owen't mother knew just what to do, and everyone -- Owen, Fuzzy, and even Mrs. Tweezers -- was happy. </p><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />The clinical name is <i>transitional object</i>, but for young children, a beloved blanket is more like  a lifeline. And that's exactly how Owen feels about his baby blanket, fondly named Fuzzy. The Owen-Fuzzy  relationship is cruising along smoothly until a nosy neighbor, Mrs. Tweezers, leans over the fence and asks  his parents, "Isn't he getting a little old to be carrying that thing around?" With kindergarten just around the  corner, Owen's parents wonder if he should in fact relinquish his prized Fuzzy. Kevin Henkes uses his  signature mouse characters and jewel-tone watercolors to explore the antics and foils of one mouse-boy, one  rag-blanket, and two parents wondering how to help their son kick the habit. This is what Henkes does best--playfully bringing childhood fears and feelings to the surface while portraying real-life parent-child  tensions. Mrs. Tweezers, a real sourpuss, is no help at all. She offers terrible over-the-fence advice, such as  dipping Fuzzy in vinegar (as if to cure a nail-biting habit) or stealing the blanket in the night.  <P> It is not until the eve of Owen's first day of kindergarten that his mother hatches the perfect solution.  Ultimately, she finds a way that Owen can hang on to his first true love while also taking the next step into  middle childhood--a solution that suits everyone, including Mrs. Tweezers.

But Lilly, his sister, disagrees. She thinks he is disgusting. She hopes he will go away, but he doesn't. Then, when cousin Garland has a few things to say about the situation, Lilly has a change of heart, and realizes that babies are not all bad.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />For children who are facing the arrival of a new sibling, <I>Julius, the Baby of the World</I> makes for great biblio-therapy. At first, big sister Lilly thought it might be fun to have a new baby in the family. But when her parents repeatedly coo, "Julius is the baby of world," Lilly's mouse hackles begin to rise. Soon the jealousy is too much for her, and she embarks on a rejection campaign that is hysterically funny, but also comforting for siblings who  probably feel just as much resentment but would never go to Lilly's extremes. Kevin Henkes, creator of  <I>Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse</I> refuses to shy away from the truly powerful and sometimes dark feelings of children. Through bright watercolors and handwritten, cartoon-style dialogue, Henkes relishes Lilly's wickedness. For example, she delights in insulting her oblivious baby brother: "If you were a food, you'd be a raisin," she whispers into his crib. "If you were a number you'd be zero." When she paints an elaborate family portrait, she leaves Julius out. When she throws a tea party, guess which baby doesn't get an invitation? But when a visiting cousin starts insulting baby Julius, we discover that the flip side of Lilly's intense jealousy is an even more powerful and lasting loyalty.

They set off to find somewhere cozy and interesting, but nothing seems quite right. Then Mommy comes to help, and Humphrey and Mop find a warm, secret place that is just perfect. <br><br><i>Humphrey's Corner</i> introduces an endearing character who will remind readers of their own favorite toddlers, and will remind toddlers of their own cozy, interesting places.<br></div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Armed with his blanket (Mooey), his toy rabbit (Mop), a stool, and  various odds and ends he picks up along the way, elephant toddler Humphrey sets  out to find a perfect place in his house to play. He tries the bathroom, his  mother's room, and a closet, but nothing is quite right. Finally, stranded in  his mother's high heels on the stairs with his box precariously perched on the  step above him, and Mop toppled down below, tired little Humphrey has worn  himself out. Just in time, Mummy, who has been seen as a quiet background  presence throughout, folding laundry and puttering in the bathroom, shows up to  save the day. Comfortably and comfortingly, she scoops up her boy under one arm  and his toys under the other, and finds him the best spot of all: a cozy hideout  in the kitchen behind the drying rack, close to jelly sandwiches, and, most  importantly, to Mummy.<p> Sally Hunter's endearing elephant is guaranteed to win the hearts of every  reader. There's nothing like the tottering yet purposeful play of a toddler;  Hunter's sketchy watercolor and pencil drawings capture the scene perfectly.

"Don't be fooled by the title of this seriocomic ode to success; it's not 'Climb Every Mountain,' kid version. All journeys face perils, whether from indecision, from loneliness, or worst of all, from too much waiting. Seuss' familiar pajama-clad hero is up to the challenge, and his odyssey is captured vividly in busy two-page spreads evoking both the good times (grinning purple elephants, floating golden castles) and the bad (deep blue wells of confusion). Seuss' message is simple but never sappy: life may be a 'Great Balancing Act,' but through it all 'There's fun to be done.'"--(starred) <i>Booklist.</i>   <br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Inspirational yet honest, and always rhythmically rollicking, <I>Oh, the Places You'll Go!</I> is a perfect sendoff for children, 1 to 100, entering any new phase of their lives. Kindergartners, graduate students, newlyweds, newly employeds--all will glean shiny pearls of wisdom about the big, bountiful future. The incomparable Dr. Seuss rejoices in the potential everyone has to fulfill their wildest dreams: "You'll be on your way up! / You'll be seeing great sights! / You'll join the high fliers / who soar to high heights." At the same time, he won't delude the starry-eyed upstart about the pitfalls of life: "You can get all hung up / in a prickle-ly perch. / And your gang will fly on. / You'll be left in a Lurch."<p> But fear not! Dr. Seuss, with his inimitable illustrations and exhilarating rhymes, is convinced ("98 and 3/4 percent guaranteed") that success is imminent.  As long as you remember "to be dexterous and deft. And NEVER mix up your right foot with your left," things should work out. (All ages) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I><br />

"Evocative, realist pastels and atmospheric text." (Sunday Times). "A thrilling tale." (Independent).<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br /><div class="aplus"> <p>One couldn't select a more delightful and exciting premise for a children's book than the tale of a young boy lying awake on Christmas Eve only to have Santa Claus sweep by and take him on a trip with other children to the North Pole. And one couldn't ask for a more talented artist and writer to tell the story than Chris Van Allsburg. Allsburg, a sculptor who entered the genre nonchalantly when he created a children's book as a diversion from his sculpting, won the 1986 Caldecott Medal for this book, one of several award winners he's produced. <b>The Polar Express</b> rings with vitality and wonder.</p> <p align="left">  <hr class="bucketDivider" size="1" /> <br/> <h4><B>Amazon Exclusive: A Letter from Chris Van Allsburg</B></h4> <img align="right" border="0" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/VanAllsburg200.jpg"/> <p>Dear Amazon Readers,</p> <p>Over the past twenty-five years, many people have shared stories with me about the effect that reading <i>The Polar Express</i> has had on their families and on their celebration of Christmas.</p> <p>One of the most poignant was told to me five or six years ago at a book signing in the Midwest, on a snowy December evening.  As I inscribed a book to a woman in her sixties, she told me that it was the second copy she had owned, and wanted to know if she could she tell me what had happened to the first.  "Of course," I answered.</p> <p>A dozen years earlier the woman, who had no children of her own, befriended a neighbor, a boy of about seven, named Eddie.  He would often cross his driveway to visit her.</p> <p>She had a collection of picture books, which she read to him, but around the holidays, the only story he ever wanted to hear, over and over, was <i>The Polar Express</i>.  One year she offered to give him the book, but Eddie declined because he wanted to hear her read it aloud to him, which she continued to do every year until the boy and his family moved away.</p> <p>Years later the woman learned from a mutual acquaintance that Eddie had grown up and become a soldier. He was stationed in Iraq. Since Christmas was approaching, the woman decided to send him a gift box. She included candy, cookies, socks, and her old copy of <i>The Polar Express</i>. She wasn't sure what a nineteen-year-old battle-weary soldier would do with the book in an army barracks in the Middle East, but she wanted him to have it. A month later, after the holidays had passed, she received a letter from Eddie.</p> <p>He told her he was very happy to have heard from her and to get the box of gifts.  He had opened it in his barracks, just before curfew, with some of his fellow GIs already in their bunks. A soldier in the next bunk spotted the book. He knew it well from his own childhood and asked Eddie to read it. "Out loud?" he asked. "Yeah," his buddy told him.</p> <p>Eddie, quietly and a little self-consciously, read <i>The Polar Express</i>. When he'd finished and closed the book, a moment of silence passed. Then from behind him a voice called out, "Read it again," and another joined in, "Yeah, read it again," and a third added, "This time, louder." So Eddie did. </p> <p>He wrote to the woman that he'd stood up and read it to his comrades just the way he remembered she had read it to him. </p> <p>All aboard,</p> <i>Chris Van Allsburg</i><br/> </p> <br/> <hr class="bucketDivider" size="1" /> <br/> <p align="left">  <h4>Recipes and Activities to Celebrate the 25th Anniversary of <i>The Polar Express</i></h4> <br> <b>(Click on Images for the Recipe or Activity [PDF])</b> <br> </p> <b>Snacks for Santa</b> <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1"  cellpadding="1">                      <tr align="center" valign="top">                                 <th width="25%">                                    <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/XmasTreeTruck250.jpg" border="0">                                                                                                    <br/>                                 Candy Cane Sugar Cookies                                    </th>                                 <td width="25%">                   <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/SantaAndBoy250.jpg"  border="0">                                                                                                  <br/> Polar Chocolate Nougat Caramel Squares                                                                                                   <br/>                                  </td>                                     <td width="25%">                                   <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/PolarExpress250.jpg"  border="0">                                                                                                   <br/>                 Christmas Snowball Cookies                                                                                  </td>                       </tr>  </table><br/><br/> <b>Fun and Games</b> <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1"  cellpadding="1">                  <tr align="center" valign="top">                                    <th width="25%">                                                                   <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/SantasSleigh250.jpg"  border="0">                                                                                                   <br/>                                                 A <i>Polar Express</i> Word Search                                                                                   </th>                                 <td width="25%">                                                                                                    <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/BoyAtDoor250.jpg" border="0">                                                                                                   <br/>                                                 A <i>Polar Express</i> Crossword                                                                                  </td>                                 <td width="25%">                                                                                                    <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/JingleBell250.jpg" border="0">                                                                                                    <br/>                                                 A <i>Polar Express</i> Maze                                                                                  </td>                 </tr>  </table>  <br/> <hr class="bucketDivider" size="1" /> <br/> </div><br />

Born in the margins of a 1997 notebook filled with potential picture book ideas, he was complaining that his ideas were better than mine.

So I suppose it wasn’t too crazy an idea. I started to revise the layout and work with color.</td> <td width="25%">At the end of 2001, after several dozen rejections because the book was “unusual,” an editor decided that “unusual” was a good thing. Plus, it made her laugh. I began reworking and rewriting. The Pigeon was now starting to look more like his mature self.</td> <td width="25%">Don’t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus! was published in April 2003 and, to my surprise, proved to be popular quite quickly.

But a mystery is afoot, for in the midst of the games, music, and revelry, someone has eaten the birthday feast. The rhyming text and lavish, detailed illustrations each provide clues, and it's up to the reader to piece them together and decide whodunit!  "The fun of poring over the pictures is matched by the enjoyment derived from the textwitty, ingenious verses." -- <i>Publishers Weekly</i>  Graeme Base is the author of many award-winning books for children, including <i>Animalia</i> (Puffin), <i>The Sign of the Seahorse</i>, and most recently, <i>The Discovery of Dragons</i>.</div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Reading <I>The Eleventh Hour</I> is like running a marathon: one finishes exhausted but satisfied. Graeme Base, creator of the popular <I>Animalia</I>, has crafted another intricately wrought, gorgeously illustrated picture book, this time a mystery in verse. When Horace the Elephant decides to throw himself a party for his 11th birthday, he never suspects a crime will be committed by lunchtime. Who has stolen the birthday feast? As with any good mystery, everyone is guilty until proven innocent. The proof lies in the myriad clues embedded in each glorious illustration. Young sleuths will delight in decoding the complex messages that pop up in unexpected places.<p> Graeme Base used the buildings he saw during his travels through Africa, Asia, and Europe to design and decorate Horace's fantastic house. Astute readers may recognize Roman cathedrals, Scottish palaces, and stone carvings from India. Best of all, secreted in these walls are cryptic messages in Egyptian hieroglyphics, anagrams, and even Morse code to challenge the perceptive and deductive abilities of any reader "of tender years or long in tooth." <I>The Eleventh Hour</I> is a brilliant, rigorous, creative romp that no child (or adult) should miss. <I>(All Ages)</I><br />

Beauty, as you may recall, is the youngest daughter of a devoted father who has fallen on hard times. Returning from a journey, he picks a rose for his daughter, enraging the owner of the rosebush, the fearsome boarlike Beast who inhabits a nearby castle. As payment for the rose, Beauty must leave her family and reside in the Beast's castle as his companion. She gradually comes to appreciate the Beast's kind nature, and, after leaving him to visit her family, realizes that she has fallen in love! Beauty willingly returns to her Beast, in time to break the spell that has caused his current, beastly countenance and restore him (and the servants in the castle) to their human forms.<p> Jan Brett--well-known for her artistry in <i>Goldilocks and the Three Bears</i> and <i>The Mitten</i>--has worked her usual magic on this beautiful edition of <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>. In a unique visual spin on the story, the tapestries hung on the walls of the Beast's castle reveal the true identities of the animal servants who are under the same spell as the Beast--a subtle, fascinating feature that may not be noticed until the second or third reading. The story's old-fashioned and graceful language perfectly accompanies the French court setting. One of the finest takes on this classic tale, Brett's <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> is described by <I>Kirkus Reviews</I> as "a lovely, carefully made edition of an old favorite." <I>(Ages 5 to 8)</I><br />

Apparently, plenty of others think so, too. First some children ask to join him, then a rabbit, a cat, a dog, a pig, a sheep... Soon,  Mr. Gumpy's boat is precariously full, and there's nowhere for anyone else to go--but overboard! This mild mariner takes everything in stride, though, and his guests are soon bellying up to a nice tea.<p> John Burningham earned the Kate Greenaway Medal, an ALA Notable Children's Book award, and the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award for <I>Mr. Gumpy's Outing</I>, and it's no wonder. This gifted and highly original author-illustrator creates a vision of glorious summer with deeply textured, sometimes only suggested, drawings. His tentatively questioning animals are ready to step right out of the pages and quietly join the delighted reader. And the simple, repetitive dialogue will lull the listener as long as it takes the characters to reach the boat's maximum  capacity. Even then, there's no big splash--just an understated, Burningham-esque "and into the water they fell." Young readers will never tire of this gentle, comforting storybook. (Ages 2 to 6) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I><br />

Awarded the Caldecott Medal for the most distinguished American picture book for children in 1941, it has since become a favorite of millions. This classic tale of the famous Mallard ducks of Boston is available for the first time in a full-sized paperback edition.<br>    <br>     <i>Make Way for Ducklings</i> has been described as "one of the merriest picture books ever" (<b>The New York Times</b>). Ideal for reading aloud, this book deserves a place of honor on every child's bookshelf.<br>    <br>    <br>     "This delightful picture book captures the humor and beauty of one special duckling family. ... McClosky's illustrations are brilliant and filled with humor. The details of the ducklings, along with the popular sights of Boston, come across wonderfully. The image of the entire family proudly walking in line is a classic."<i>—The Barnes & Noble Review</i><br>    <br>     "The quaint story of the mallard family's search for the perfect place to hatch ducklings. ... For more than fifty years kids have been entertained by this warm and wonderful story."—<i>Children's Literature</i></p></div><br><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />It's not easy for duck parents to find a safe place to bring up their ducklings, but during a rest stop in Boston's Public Garden, Mr. and Mrs.  Mallard think they just might have found the perfect spot--no foxes or turtles in sight, plenty of peanuts from pleasant passers-by, and the benevolent instincts of a kindly police officer to boot. Young readers will love the mother duck's proud, loving protection of her wee webbed ones, and those with fond memories of Boston will enjoy familiar locales, from Beacon Hill to Louisburg Square, and over the Charles River--often from a duck's-eye view. Robert McCloskey, creator of <I>Blueberries for Sal</I>, never fails to elicit happy story-time giggles from youngsters, and his soft, brown-toned, Caldecott-winning illustrations make this gentle world come alive.

If you come to Paris with Eloise you will always be glad you did. <BR> <I>Eloise in Paris</I> was first published in 1957, the second of the Eloise quartet, and an immediate bestseller. Kay Thompson and Hilary Knight traveled to Paris to research the book, and the illustrations are dotted with the celebrities they knew there: Richard Avedon takes Eloise's passport photograph; Christian Dior prods her tummy, while his young assistant, Yves Saint Laurent, looks on; Lena Horne sits at an outdoor café. <BR> All four Eloise books by the late Kay Thompson and Hilary Knight -- <I>Eloise: The Absolutely Essential Edition, Eloise in Paris, Eloise at Christmastime,</I> and <I>Eloise in Moscow --</I> are now being reissued by Simon & Schuster.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Why is Eloise, 6-year-old resident of the Plaza Hotel in New York City, going to Paris? She and Nanny were summoned by a cablegram from Eloise's mother, and, as we all know, "If you are going to Paris France / you have to turn into French and absolutely go wild / and put adhesive tape on you / and fall down a lot and sklathe the window / and stretch into the curtain and..." Ahh, the deliciously mad logic of Eloise. She promptly gets on the phone to tell everyone--including room service--that she is Paris bound. There's so much to do--shots, passport pictures, packing ("Here's what else you have to take / Everything"), and of course the endless good-byes. Fortunately, "Sabena is the only airline / that will allow you to travel with a turtle" so Skipperdee comes along for the ride. At last, <i>ils arrivent</i>! <p> Hilary Knight captures familiar Parisian sights in his delicately hewn pen-and-ink illustrations of everything from the Arc de Triomphe to the Seine to the Champs Élysées to outdoor cafés. Children will study  every detail of each <i>rawther</i> extraordinaire illustration, from Weenie's snout (such as it is) peeking out from under the hotel bed to the bandy-legged, bunchy-shirted Eloise with her necklace of champagne corks. Even if children don't understand half of the quirks and language directed toward precocious grownups ("Langoustines make very good fingernails"), they'll find more than enough to delight them down to their very toes. Adults, of course, will also revel in this fascinatingly eccentric romp. And if you know anyone who loves (or will love) Paris, this book is the perfect bon voyage gift. <I>Eloise in Paris</I> was first published in 1957, the sequel to the original <I>Eloise</I>, and is every bit as wondrous. If you're in search of more Eloise (and who isn't really?), don't miss <I>The Absolutely Essential Eloise</I>, the original <I>Eloise</I> book with an additional scrapbook that tells the whole story of this impish character and her devoted creators.

But Henny wants a brood of chicks and she needs her eggs. With the help of clever Hedgie, she substitutes an acorn, a strawberry, a mushroom and finally a potato in her nest. But nothing stops that Tomten until the little hedgehog hides in Henny's nest: when the Tomten reaches in to get his morning treat, all he gets is a handful of prickles. He runs home for porridge and never comes back again!   Intricate needlepoint patterns of Scandinavian designs frame the characters reacting from the borders in this beautiful picture book set in Denmark.</div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Henny doesn't know what to do. Every morning the irksome gnomelike  Tomten steals her egg and takes it home to cook in his kettle and gobble up for  breakfast. But when she sees Goosey-Goosey sailing by with a gaggle of goslings,  Henny is suddenly galvanized to do <I>something</I>. Will she never have chicks  of her own? She consults her wise friend Hedgie the Hedgehog, who comes up with  a clever plan guaranteed to give the Tomten a sharp lesson in appropriate  behavior. <p> Jan Brett's trademark illustrations--detailed watercolors bordered by intricate  needlepoint patterns---capture the charm and mischief of this Scandinavian-style  folk tale set in Denmark. Each wide woven margin shows a hint in miniature of  upcoming events: Hedgie crawling under Henny's brooding basket, or the enraged  Tomten after being outwitted. Young readers will love guessing what Hedgie has  up his proverbial sleeve, and will rejoice with Henny at the unusual hatching of  her first brood of chicks. A warm, humorous, 100 percent satisfying story by the  creator of many picture book favorites, such as <I>The Hat</I> and <I>The Mitten</I>. (Ages 3 to 7)  <I>--Emilie Coulter</I><br />

Soon he's joined by two cats, then three frogs, then four turtles, then five fish. But one group by one, his new friends decide to head home, leaving the rooster alone again -- and ready to return to his own comfortable home as well. Bold, colorful collage illustrations, a beguiling story, and a simple introduction to number sets, addition, and subtraction combine to make <I>Rooster's Off to See the World</I> a delight for Eric Carle's many young fans.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />With his lush, gorgeous collages, Eric Carle hardly needs to write a  word to make his picture books appealing. <I>Rooster's Off to See the World</I>,  in fact, may have been more successful as a wordless book. Rooster wakes up one  morning and decides he wants to travel. Off he goes, picking up companions along  the way (two cats, three frogs, four turtles, etc.). When night falls, the  critters become cold and lonely and hungry, and, group by group, return home. It  seems the message here is, "there's no place like home"; reassuring for  toddlers, to be sure, but somehow a bit sad and disappointing, too. This small  board-book edition is crowded with Carle's trademark illustrations, stunning in  color and form--but also with wordy text and counting graphics in the upper  right corner of each spread. The adding and subtracting element is an attractive  and clever feature, but ultimately, it's a little too much. This said, children  and adults will probably be so mesmerized by Carle's colorful collages, the rest  won't matter. (Baby to preschool) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I><br />

The combination of text and Oliver Jeffers' illustrations match the colors' personalities beautifully as the crayons share their concern, appreciation, or downright frustration:  yellow and orange demand to know the true color of the sun, while green--clearly the people pleaser of the bunch--is happy with his workload of crocodiles, trees, and dinosaurs.  Peach crayon wants to know why his wrapper was torn off, leaving him naked and in hiding; blue is exhausted and, well, worn out; and pink wants a little more paper time. The result of this letter writing campaign is colorful creativity and after reading this book I will never look at crayons the same way again--nor would I want to. ---<i>Seira Wilson</i><br />

The tale begins with little Nona's birth on a dark and stormy night, and ends where the original <b>Strega Nona</b> picks up-with Strega Nona taking on the bumbling, knock-kneed Big Anthony as an apprentice. This winsome story is illustrated throughout with Tomie dePaola's warm and sunny watercolors!     "dePaola does a splendid job of working this sparkling tale into the Strega Nona canon." -<b>Publishers Weekly</b> </div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br /><div class="aplus">   <span class="h1"><strong>Eric Carle and Tomie dePaola: Author One-on-One</strong></span>  <br> <br>  <strong>Eric Carle</strong> is the creator, author, and illustrator of <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> and many other children’s books.  <strong>Tomie dePaola</strong> is the author and illustrator of <i>Strega Nona: Her Story</i> and countless other books. They recently had a conversation about their careers as picture book authors. <img alt="Eric Carle" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/PenguinEMS2010/carle._V193782074_.jpg" style="float: right; border: 1px solid black; margin: 5px;"> <br>  <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> When I was only four years old, I announced to my family in particular and to the world in general that I was going to become an artist, and write stories and draw pictures for books. I never swayed from that early declaration. I’ve always been curious to know, what inspired you to become a creator and illustrator of picture books? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> My career began as a graphic designer and for a number of years I worked as an art director for an advertising agency in New York. In the mid 1960's Bill Martin, Jr. saw an ad of a red lobster that I had designed and asked me to illustrate his <i>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</i> Well, I was set on fire! I was so inspired by this book, and the opportunity to illustrate it changed my life. After that, I started to create my own books, both words and pictures, and really it was then that I had found my true course in life.  <br> <br> Now, I have a question for you, Tomie. How would you describe your artistic style, and has it changed over time? <br>  <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> My illustration style is heavily influenced by folk art--strong simple shapes, bold lines, color, color, color and a deceptive simplicity.  My style began to develop early in art school, and through the years, it hasn’t changed very much, but it has refined itself. How would you describe yours? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> My aim with my work is to simplify and refine, be logical and harmonious. I like to use simple shapes, bright colors and a lot of white space. I write for the child inside of me. That is always where I begin.  <br> <br>  <img alt="Tomie dePaola" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/PenguinEMS2010/DePaola2._V193763066_.jpg" style="float: right; border: 1px solid black; margin: 5px;">  <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> I do, as well. The only audience I keep in mind is that four-year-old in me. People sometimes ask me what advice I would give to young artists. I always think of the wonderful advice I received from my twin cousins when they were in art school in the late '30s. They told me, “Practice, practice, practice and don’t copy.”  <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> I often tell people about the four magic letters: DO IT.  I want to be encouraging but I can only offer the example of my own experience, which is just one approach. There are many wonderful artists to learn about, which is important. But you must use your own imagination. You have to just do it.  <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> How do you feel knowing that a copy of <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> is sold every 30 seconds, somewhere in the world? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> It is hard for me, maybe for others too, to grasp this concept. But I am truly honored that my story is enjoyed by so many and that it is now being shared by a generation of parents who grew up with my book. How about your <i>Strega Nona</i>. She is one of your most popular characters. Can you share how she came to be? <br>  <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> In the ‘70s when I was teaching at a college, we were required to attend faculty meetings.  I always sat in the back with a yellow legal pad.  Everyone thought I was taking notes.  At one meeting a doodle appeared of a little lady with a big nose and a big chin.  I named her Strega Nona, and the rest is history. Speaking of history, how will you be celebrating the third annual <i>Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> Day this year? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> On <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> Day, March 20th, I will probably be at home with my wife, Bobbie (I am a bit of a hermit, actually). But I will be saying a little toast to the caterpillar for whom I have a special place in my heart. And speaking of holidays, isn’t your favorite holiday Christmas. Do you have a special Christmas memory? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> Christmas is my favorite holiday. My favorite Christmas was the one when I received tons and tons of art supplies: everything from an easel to paints, pads and pads of paper, and “how to draw” books. <br> </div><br />

Thirsting for knowledge and eager to improve his craft, he risks losing all that is important to him, including the love of his beautiful Sorrel.<p>The journey brings many discoveries, and though he tries hard to absorb the vast new tapestry of sounds and ideas before him, the scope of choices eventually becomes overwhelming.<p>Dispirited, he turns for home -- and alone in the grace of nature, he experiences a series of wondrous events that lead him to the discovery of his own true self, and the glorious gift he has to offer.<p>Julie Andrews Edwards and Emma Walton Hamilton -- with stunning illustrations from Gennady Spirin -- weave a magical tale with a timeless lesson about beauty, music, and the power of giving.</p><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Convinced that his "lowly status" and the "simplicity of his art" will never provide more than a "meager existence" for his beloved, minstrel Simeon sets out on a fairy tale-like quest to free the music "deep in his soul." He encounters a veritable symphony of new sounds on his pilgrimage--the insistent beat of soldiers' drums, the harmonic chanting of monks, the general cacophony of a big city--but sadly, this barrage of new sounds bewilders and overwhelms Simeon, who feels his own attempts at song suffer in comparison. Lonely and weary, he abandons his quest and trades his lute for a canoe to take him home. On the way, Simeon befriends a bright little bird, a beautiful fish, and lovely fawn who become his companions. Heartened by his new friends and overjoyed to see his beloved Sorrel, Simeon breaks into song and discovers the music of his soul.<p> Julie Andrews Edwards, author of <I>The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles</I> and star of <I>Mary Poppins</I> and <I>The Sound of Music</I>, has teamed up again with her daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton (<I>Dumpy the Dumptruck</I>, etc.), for an original story with all the elements of traditional fairy tales. Award-winning illustrator Gennady Spirin creates magical pictures that hearken back to Renaissance era artists. Also includes a reading by the charming Julie Andrews Edwards.

Maybe Mockingbird can teach him to sing songs with the finches, flycatchers, and cardinals and help him make some friends. But Little Crow should be careful what he wishes for... Using Mockingbird's tip, Little Crow quickly becomes the most popular bird on the block. But, in a moment of danger, he learns that singing someone else's song can have terrible consequences and that his own voice and his father's love is of the greatest value. Paired with colorful collage illustrations, this inspirational story is complemented by fun facts about North American birds and their sounds. Grades Pre-K to 2.<br />

"Don't be fooled by the title of this seriocomic ode to success; it's not 'Climb Every Mountain,' kid version. All journeys face perils, whether from indecision, from loneliness, or worst of all, from too much waiting. Seuss' familiar pajama-clad hero is up to the challenge, and his odyssey is captured vividly in busy two-page spreads evoking both the good times (grinning purple elephants, floating golden castles) and the bad (deep blue wells of confusion). Seuss' message is simple but never sappy: life may be a 'Great Balancing Act,' but through it all 'There's fun to be done.'"--(starred) <i>Booklist.</i>   <br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Inspirational yet honest, and always rhythmically rollicking, <I>Oh, the Places You'll Go!</I> is a perfect sendoff for children, 1 to 100, entering any new phase of their lives. Kindergartners, graduate students, newlyweds, newly employeds--all will glean shiny pearls of wisdom about the big, bountiful future. The incomparable Dr. Seuss rejoices in the potential everyone has to fulfill their wildest dreams: "You'll be on your way up! / You'll be seeing great sights! / You'll join the high fliers / who soar to high heights." At the same time, he won't delude the starry-eyed upstart about the pitfalls of life: "You can get all hung up / in a prickle-ly perch. / And your gang will fly on. / You'll be left in a Lurch."<p> But fear not! Dr. Seuss, with his inimitable illustrations and exhilarating rhymes, is convinced ("98 and 3/4 percent guaranteed") that success is imminent.  As long as you remember "to be dexterous and deft. And NEVER mix up your right foot with your left," things should work out. (All ages) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I><br />

It's the talk of the jungle when an elephant<br><br>hatches an egg. Extravagant nonsense and rollicking verse. <br><br><br><br><br><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Poor Horton. Dr. Seuss's kindly elephant is persuaded to sit on an egg while its mother, the good-for-nothing bird lazy Maysie, takes a break. Little does Horton know that Maysie is setting off for a permanent vacation in Palm Springs. He waits, and waits, never leaving his precarious branch, even through a freezing winter and a spring that's punctuated by the insults of his friends. ("They taunted.  They teased him. They yelled 'How Absurd! Old Horton the Elephant thinks he's a bird!'") Further indignities await, but Horton has the patience of Job--from whose story this one clearly derives--and he is rewarded in the end by the surprise birth of... an elephant-bird. <I>Horton Hatches the Egg</I> contains some of Theodor Geisel's most inspired verse and some of his best-ever illustrations, the dated style of which only accentuates their power and charm. A book no childhood should be without. (Ages 2 to 7) <I>--Richard Farr</I><br />

When a fox in socks meets Knox in a box, you know that hilarity will ensue. Add chicks with bricks (and blocks and clocks) and you’re sure to get your words twisted and lips locked. With his unmistakable gift for rhyme, Dr. Seuss creates a hysterical and energetic way for beginning readers to dive into the joy of reading. This book comes with the following warning: “This is a book you READ ALOUD to find out just how smart your tongue is. The first time you read it, don’t go fast! This Fox is a tricky fox. He’ll try to get your tongue in trouble.” <br><br> Originally created by Dr. Seuss, Beginner Books encourage children to read all by themselves, with simple words and illustrations that give clues to their meaning.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />"This Fox is a tricky fox. He'll try to get your tongue in trouble." Dr. Seuss gives fair warning to anyone brave enough to read along with the Fox in Socks, who likes to play tongue-twisting games with his friend Mr. Knox. "Here's an easy game to play. Here's an easy thing to say.... New socks. Two socks. Whose socks? Sue's socks." But Mr. Fox Socks isn't about to let Knox off so easy. Soon Goo-Goose is choosing to chew chewy gluey blue goo, while tweetle beetles battle with paddles in a puddle (in case you were wondering, that's called a "tweetle beetle puddle paddle battle"). Mr. Knox gets exasperated: "I can't blab such blibber blubber! My tongue isn't made of rubber." But he catches on to the game before it's all through. One of Seuss's best, this must-read-aloud classic is guaranteed to get many giggles out of readers young and old. (Ages 4 to 8) <I>--Paul Hughes</I><br />

From big dogs and little dogs to red, green, and blue dogs, dogs going up and dogs going fast . . . who knew dogs were so busy? And laughter will ensue at the repeated question “Do you like my hat?” Like P. D. Eastman’s classic <i>Are You My Mother?</i> <i>Go, Dog. Go!</i> has been a go-to favorite for over fifty years, leaving audiences of all breeds wagging their tails with delight.<br><br> Originally created by Dr. Seuss, Beginner Books encourage children to read all by themselves, with simple words and illustrations that give clues to their meaning.<br><br> "The canine cartoons make an elementary text funny and coherent and still one of the best around."--<i>School Library Journal.  </i><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Life lessons? Romance? Literary instruction? <I>Go, Dog. Go!</I> offers all this and more, wrapped up in one simply worded, warmly hued package. Using single-syllable words in rhythmic repetition, and introducing colors and prepositions, this Seuss-styled classic has been an early favorite of children since 1961. For those looking for deeper meaning in a beginning reader book, here you'll find nothing less than a microcosm of life. Green dogs, yellow dogs, big dogs, little dogs. Dogs who prefer cars, dogs who favor skis. All represent the diversity a child will find in the world. And the slow-to-bud romance between the cheerfully oblivious yellow dog and the mincing pink poodle explains more succinctly than most self-help books what goes on in many grown-up relationships. Nonetheless, Eastman takes the concept of "primary" to heart, with his simple silly phrases and solidly colored illustrations. Not only will this book inspire peals of laughter in kids, it will also help them make the magical connection between those mysterious black squiggles on the page, and the words they hear and speak. <I>(Ages 4 to 8)</I><br />

The visual images have a sense of depth and seem to invite readers into this special nighttime world."--School Library Journal, starred review. Full color. 1988 Caldecott Medal Book.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Among the greatest charms of children is their ability to view a simple activity as a magical adventure. Such as a walk in the woods late at night. Jane Yolen captures this wonderment in a book whose charm rises from its simplicity. "It was late one winter night, long past my bedtime, when Pa and I went owling." The two walked through the woods with nothing but hope and each other in a journey that will fascinate many a child. John Schoenherr's illustrations help bring richness to the countryside adventure. The book won the 1988 Caldecott Medal.<br />

Then a friendly robin shows her the way to a mysterious garden that has been locked up for years. Mary is determined to bring the secret garden  back to life and, along the way, finds good friends and discovers the magic of making things grow. <p> Frances Hodgson Burnett's <em>The Secret Garden</em> has been loved by generations of children since its first publication in 1912. Now, for the first time, young readers can unlock the mystery of the secret garden with this very special picture book, adapted form Burnett's classic work. Mary Collier's rich, glorious paintings, inspired  by the original novel, bring all the magic and wonder of the secret garden glowingly to life.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Mistress Mary is quite contrary until she helps her garden grow. Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <I>The Secret Garden</I>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate. Frances Hodgson Burnett creates characters so strong and distinct, young readers continue to identify with them even 85 years after they were conceived. <I>(Ages 9 to 12)</I><br />

It is Kitten's first full moon, and when she sees it she thinks it is a bowl of milk in the sky. And she wants it. Does she get it? Well, no . . . and yes. What a night!</p><p>A brief text, large type, and luminescent pictures play second fiddle to the star of this classic picture book—brave, sweet and lucky Kitten! "Henkes's text, reminiscent of Margaret Wise Brown's work in the elemental words, rhythms, and appealing sounds, tells a warm, humorous story that's beautifully extended in his shimmering, gray-toned artwork."—<em>ALA Booklist</em> </p><p>Winner of the Caldecott Medal, an ALA Notable Book, a <em>New York Times</em> Best Illustrated Book, and winner of the Charlotte Zolotow Award</p><p>Supports the Common Core State Standards</p><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />In this beautiful picture book, winner of the 2005 Caldecott Medal, Kevin Henkes, captures the sweet, sometimes slapstick struggle of Kitten, who sees her first full moon and thinks it's a bowl of milk in the sky.<p> Any child who has yearned for anything will understand how much Kitten wants that elusive bowl of milk. Readers will giggle as she tries to lick the faraway moon and gets a bug on her tongue, or leaps to catch it and falls down the stairs. In an effective refrain, the narrator repeats, "Still, there was the little bowl of milk, just waiting." The winning combination here is the simplicity and humor of the story, paired with gorgeous black-and-white illustrations with thick black lines (mirrored by the thick bold sans-serif font) and shades of grey that are as luminous as a moonlit night should be. Full-moon circles and ovals appear throughout the design: white circle full moons on the endpapers, elliptical flowers by the porch, white circles of firefly light, oval pads on Kitten's paws, and her big round eyes (especially when surprised and soaking wet). Children will love Kitten's quest and ensuing comedy of errors, but what they will love even more is that there's an actual bowl of milk waiting on the porch for Kitten.

I know about pirates, because one day, when I was at the beach building a sand castle and minding my own business, a pirate ship sailed into view.</I></div> <div>So proclaims Jeremy Jacob, a boy who joins Captain Braid Beard and his crew in this witty look at the finer points of pirate life by the Caldecott Honor–winning illustrator David Shannon and the storyteller Melinda Long. Jeremy learns how to say “scurvy dog,” sing sea chanteys, and throw food . . . but he also learns that there are no books or good night kisses on board: “Pirates don’t tuck.” A swashbuckling adventure with fantastically silly, richly textured illustrations that suit the story to a T.<br></div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Young Jeremy Jacob is plucked from obscurity while innocently constructing a sand castle and is thrust into a brand-new life as a pirate. Captain Braid Beard and his crew recognize Jeremy as an exceptionally talented digger and they happen to be in desperate need of a digger to help them bury a treasure chest. Jeremy thinks a pirate life sounds like fun, as long as he’s back the next day in time for soccer practice, and so he goes along with the ragtag group of seafaring thugs (with hearts of gold, naturally). And while Jeremy adores the pirates’ lack of table manners and opposition to vegetables, he comes to realize that a life away from his parents lacks some of the niceties to which he’s become accustomed. Nobody tucks him in at night, for instance, and the only book available to read is a treasure map. Melinda Long’s story, narrated with a sense of boastful exaggeration by Jeremy, is full of a sense of high adventure that's lovingly evocative of Robert Louis Stevenson’s classic tales. David Shannon's illustrations, full of a goofy vibrancy, are a perfect accompaniment to the story. (Ages 4 to 8) <I>--John Moe</I><br />

For this edition, created for the twenty-fifth anniversay in 1992, Bill Martin, Jr., restored his text to its original wording. And Eric Carle created all new pictures--based on the originals, but clearer, brighter, and truer to the colors they represent.<BR><BR>Bill Martin has been devoted to writing children's books for more than thirty years. He has a Ph.D. in early childhood education and he has long been a proponent of using rhyme and rhythm to teach young children how to read.<BR><BR>Eric Carle, illustrator of many beloved children's books, was born in the United States, but spent his early years in Stuttgart, Germany, where he studied art and design at the Academy of Applied Art. <I>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</I> was the first book he illustrated.<BR></DIV><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br /><div class="aplus"> <h4>The Origins of <em>Brown Bear</em></h4> <p>On a train ride in 1966, the title phrase <em>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</em> popped into Bill Martin Jr.'s head. Later, he spotted an illustration of a red lobster in a magazine and contacted the creator, Eric Carle, to ask if he would illustrate his poem. So began Eric Carle's career as a children's book illustrator--along with a life-long collaborative friendship with Bill Martin Jr. Since then, <em>Brown Bear</em> and the three companion titles, <em>Polar Bear</em>, <em>Panda Bear</em>, and <em>Baby Bear</em>, have gone on to sell millions of copies worldwide.</p> <p>The Bear books are a cultural landmark and a key milestone in many children's reading lives. And many adults today remember reading the Bear books themselves as well as the experience of reading them for the first time to their own children. Whether in a picture book or a reader, and now in eBook and audio, the same bold graphics and repetitive, rhythmic text have truly stood the test of time.</p> <p>Throughout Eric Carle's career, he has shown an unshakeable commitment to artistic integrity and a dedication to making art accessible to children. His skillfully designed and beautifully rendered collage art is admired by fellow artists, colleagues and fans in equal measure. And in 2002, with his wife Barbara, Eric founded The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art in Amherst, Massachusetts, the first museum of its kind in the United States.</p> <p><em>--Laura Godwin, Vice President and Publisher, Henry Holt Books for Young Readers</em></p> <br/> <h4>A Question for Eric Carle</h4> <p><strong>Before the Bear books, you worked in advertising but had not yet created a children's book. What went through your mind when you first heard from author Bill Martin Jr. about the <em>Brown Bear</em> manuscript? What made you want to illustrate it?</strong></p> <p><strong>Eric Carle:</strong> At that point I was doing work-for-hire and I was very pleased to have the chance to do something different. I went through the manuscript and could see in my mind images of bright colorful animals, big and bold and simple like in posters. I was actually able to finish the art for this book and deliver it in one weekend. The whole process felt right and I was very excited by the opportunity to work on the book with Bill, which really changed my life and set me on the true course in my career.</p> <div class="third-col"> <img alt="Eric Carle 1" height="188" src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hopub/kids/EricCarleStudioSM.jpg" width="250" /> <div class="imageCaption"><p>Eric Carle at work in his studio, Northampton, MA</p></div></div> <div class="third-col"> <img alt="Eric Carle 2" height="188" src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hopub/kids/EricCarleMamaBear.gif" width="250" /> <div class="imageCaption"><p>Sketches of Mama Bear for <em>Baby Bear</em></p></div></div> <div class="third-col last"> <img alt="Eric Carle 3" height="188" src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hopub/kids/EricCarleBabyBrSketchSM.gif" width="250" /> <div class="imageCaption"><p>Eric Carle, holding a sketch from <em>Baby Bear</em></p></div></div> </div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />The gentle rhyming and gorgeous, tissue-paper collage illustrations in this classic picture book make it a dog-eared favorite on many children's bookshelves. On each page, we meet a new animal who nudges us onward to discover which creature will show up next: "Blue Horse, Blue Horse, What do you see? I see a green frog looking at me." This pattern is repeated over and over, until the pre-reader can chime in with the reader, easily predicting the next rhyme. One thing readers might not predict, however, is just what kinds of funny characters will make an appearance at the denouement! Children on the verge of reading learn best with plenty of identifiable images and rhythmic repetition. Eric Carle's good-humored style and colorful, bold illustrations (like those in <I>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</I>, <I>The Grouchy Ladybug</I>, and <I>Have You Seen My Cat?</I>) have earned him a prominent place in the children's book hall of fame.

In fact, George is happy to share with ALL the animals! Following a trail of peanuts, the zookeepers soon catch up with George and discover this little monkey is good for more than just mischief. The adventures of Curious George continue in an all-new series beginning in fall 1998 with eight new stories. Written and illustrated in the style of Margret and H. A. Rey, the books will appear in paperback (8 x 8") and hardcover editions and will feature the art of Vipah Interactive, the animators of HMI's Curious George CD-ROMs.</div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />George is the irrepressibly curious chimp who has delighted children for more than 50 years with his inadvertent antics. Young readers know better than to trust George on his own, but somehow the  man with the yellow hat never seems to learn. Although George's  intentions are always good, trouble follows this affable ape like a  mischievous little shadow. This time the misadventures take place at  the zoo, where George and his friend have gone to see the new rain  forest exhibit. Despite the "Do not feed the animals" signs, generous  George wants to share his peanuts with the cute koalas; the poor,  ravenous alligators; and the friendly giraffes. Pandemonium ensues, but  George manages to turn things around--and even save the day!<p> Although there's something ever so slightly odd about Curious George visiting a zoo, neither he nor the other visitors seem to be bothered  by the incongruity, so why should we? Based on the original Curious  George character, and written and illustrated in the style of George's creators, this new episode in everybody's favorite impish chimp's life will delight one and all. Featuring the art of Vipah Interactive, the animators of Curious George CD-ROMs, this book will impress even the  hardcore traditionalist. Curious about George's other escapades?

Given as a Christmas gift to a young boy, the Velveteen Rabbit lives in the nursery with all of the other toys, waiting for the day when the Boy (as he is called) will choose him as a playmate. In time, the shy Rabbit befriends the tattered Skin Horse, the wisest resident of the nursery, who reveals the goal of all nursery toys: to be made "real" through the love of a human. "'Real isn't how you are made,' said the Skin Horse. 'It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.'" This sentimental classic--perfect for any child who's ever thought that maybe, just <I>maybe</I>, his or her toys have feelings--has been charming children since its first publication in 1922. <I>(A great read-aloud for all ages, but children ages 8 and up can read it on their own.)</I><br />

The art's the thing here, and there's so much to see that children will want to pore over this before and after Christmas. The hook on which the story hangs is the tumble of a curious polar bear right through a hole in the snow into Santa's study. Santa takes Cub on a tour of the property, and this is what readers will enjoy. The panoramic two-page spreads and individual panels begin at the top of the world and continue through the workshops, into the kitchen and the wrapping room (where long, colorful sheets of paper hang from the ceiling), and off to the barn. Best of all is the toy storage room. Dolls, bears, trucks, tops, robots--of every conceivable shape and size--fill the gigantic space. Talk about a kid in a candy store! Readers can plan their Christmas gifts 10 times over. There's no real story to speak of, and in the end, not surprisingly, Cub gets a ride home in the sleigh. But this is a delight to look at, like a Christmas tree sparkling with lights. Ilene Cooper --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.<br />

Her imaginative illustrations of the strange denizens of Wonderland—from the Mad Hatter and March Hare to the Queen of Hearts and Cheshire Cat—capture the inspired nonsense of Carroll's classic tale.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, <I>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</I> is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense.<p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <I>non</I>-moralistic, <I>non</I>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

As he and his mother are milling through the crowded streets--alive with firecrackers, lion dances, and shoppers--Sam accidentally steps on the foot of a homeless man who is buried in a pile of red paper. Flustered, Sam hurries back to his mother, and is soon distracted by the <I>char siu bao</I> and other sweets he might buy with his gift money. When he sees fish-tail cookies that remind him of toes, he remembers the old man again, and Sam starts to think of his "lucky money" in a new light. Karen Chinn's winning story is perfectly complemented by the vibrant watercolors of Cornelius Van Wright and Ying-Hwa Hu, creators of the award-winning <I>Zora Hurston and the Chinaberry Tree</I> and <I>A House by the River</I>. Voted "Pick of the Lists" by <I>American Bookseller</I>, <I>Sam and the Lucky Money</I> succeeds at telling a simple story, while allowing young readers to explore the sights and sounds of an American urban Chinatown during the Chinese New Year. <I>(Ages 4 to 8)</I><br />

Get ready for a wild and wonderful, rollicking romp about a telephone ringing off the hook. As we plunge into the story, our narrator (who apparently runs a bizarre, 24-hour, all-purpose supply house) has just answered a call from an elephant: "What do you want?"/I asked him up front./"If I had my druthers,"/he said in a mutter,/"I'd order some more of your peanut butter." The flood of outrageous phone requests continues, including a crocodile needing galoshes, baboons asking for spoons, and a kangaroo looking for Winnie-the-Pooh. The final affront occurs just as the overworked narrator is drifting off to sleep, when a desperate rhino calls for assistance in dragging a hippo out of a swamp. <p>In this lively translation of Kornei Chukovsky's classic Russian nonsense poem, Jamey Gambrell keeps the rhyming tempo tapping and the silliness in high gear. The illustrations by Vladimir Radunsky, who also created the brilliantly bold and wacky characters in <I>Yucka Drucka Droni</I> and <I>The Maestro Plays</I>, only add to the fervor--vivid paintings and collage are layered on expansive blocks of vibrant color, including wallpaper and fabric. Adults may never have witnessed a stronger argument for call-screening, but kids are sure to giggle the next time the phone rings. <I>(Ages 4 to 8)</I><br />

With full colour illustrations.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br /><I>The Story of Babar</I>--the early adventures of the enduring, endearing elephant--was written in 1931 by French writer Jean de Brunhoff (1899-1937). Since then, it has been translated into at least 12 languages. It's amazing how much can happen to one little elephant in the course of one little book: Babar loses his mother to a hunter, wanders into the city, gets a new wardrobe, becomes the hit of high society, marries his cousin Céleste (totally acceptable in contemporary Elephantine society), and is crowned King of the Elephants.  <P>  <I>The Story of Babar</I> is essentially the tale of a country boy who comes to the city and, while there, comes of age. In the end, he returns home to share his knowledge and experiences with family and friends. The beautiful, delightfully detailed illustrations--de Brunhoff was a painter by trade--never fail to amuse. (Although none of the characters seem to notice, the sight of Babar in a suit leaning against the mantel while he regales his audience with tales of the jungle is plainly hilarious.) All of the Babar books are notable for their ability to tell larger stories with simplicity and style, and <I>The Story of Babar</I> is no exception. Potentially troubling moments--the death of Babar's mother, for example--are handled with taste, emphasizing Babar's unique gift for uncovering a silver lining in the most persistent of clouds. (Ages 4 to 8, though the cursive writing makes it best for reading aloud.)<br />

"Kurt Wiese and Marjorie Flack have created in Ping a duckling of great individuality against a background (the Yangtze River) that has both accuracy and charm".--The New York Times. Full-color illustrations.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />The tale of a little duck alone on the Yangtze River, <I>The Story About Ping</I> is a sweet and funny book with wonderfully rich and colorful illustrations. On a day like any other, Ping sets off from the boat he calls home with his comically large family in search of "pleasant things to eat." On this particular day, he is accidentally left behind when the boat leaves. Undaunted, the little duck heads out onto the Yangtze in search of his family, only to find new friends and adventures--and a bit of peril--around every bend. <P> The exceptional illustrations bring the lush Yangtze to life, from Ping's family to the trained fishing birds he finds himself among to the faithfully rendered boats and fishermen. Certainly intended to be read aloud, <I>The Story About Ping</I> deserves a place on every young reader's (or listener's) shelf. (Picture book)<br />

The Caldecott Honor artist Paul Galdone’s delightfully detailed ink and wash illustrations—packed with charming details—add plenty of sly humor to the well-loved story that not only offers a sage message but also shows children what it takes to make a cake from the ground up!<br />

No running allowed. And you must be quiet. But when a lion comes to the library one day, no one is sure what to do. There aren't any rules about lions in the library. And, as it turns out, this lion seems very well suited to library visiting. His big feet are quiet on the library floor. He makes a comfy backrest for the children at story hour. And he never roars in the library, at least not anymore. But when something terrible happens, the lion quickly comes to the rescue in the only way he knows how. Michelle Knudsen's disarming story, illustrated by the matchless Kevin Hawkes in an expressive timeless style, will win over even the most ardent of rule keepers.<br />

Eye-catching foil stamping, glittering on every page, offers instant child appeal, but it is the universal message at the heart of this simple story about a beautiful fish who learns to make friends by sharing his most prized possessions that gives the book its lasting value. A CHRISTOPHER AWARD WINNER WINNER OF THE BOLOGNA BOOK FAIR CRITICI IN ERBA PRIZE AMERICAN BOOKSELL ABBY AWARD WINNER AN IRA-CBC CHILDREN'S CHOICE<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />If you read this very popular book just before bed, and the light is still on in the hallway, you can make the rainbow scales glitter on the page, and realize why the Rainbow Fish was so proud of his beautiful decoration. Sometimes, though, being too proud of outside beauty can blind a fish, or a child (or even, heaven forbid, a parent) to the beauty people hold inside. That's the lesson of this simple tale, imported from Switzerland. It's a useful one for future sneaker and designer clothing shoppers, for rainbow fish--and for quieter, plainer minnows, too.<br />

From <i>The Cat in the Hat</i> to <i>Oh, the Places You’ll Go!</i>, his iconic characters, stories, and art style have been a lasting influence on generations of children and adults. The books he wrote and illustrated under the name Dr. Seuss (and others that he wrote but did not illustrate, including some under the pseudonyms Theo. LeSieg and Rosetta Stone) have been translated into thirty languages. Hundreds of millions of copies have found their way into homes and hearts around the world. Dr. Seuss’s long list of awards includes Caldecott Honors for <i>McElligot’s Pool</i>, <i>If I Ran the Zoo</i>, and <i>Bartholomew and the Oobleck</i>, the Pulitzer Prize, and eight honorary doctorates. Works based on his original stories have won three Oscars, three Emmys, three Grammys, and a Peabody.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />That behatted and bow-tied cat from Dr. Seuss's <I>The Cat in the Hat</I> is back, and, not surprisingly, is up to all sorts of mischief. This time, Sally and her brother are stuck shoveling snow: "This was no time for play./ This was no time for fun./ This was no time for games./ There was work to be done." But--you guessed it--the laughing Hat Cat has other ideas, as he lets himself in to eat cake in their tub. He leaves behind "a big long pink cat ring," which he then handily cleans with "MOTHER'S WHITE DRESS!" The dress then loses its pink stain to the wall, then Dad's shoes, then the rug in the hall, until finally the Cat must call in some assistance: from inside his hat comes Little Cat A, then Littler Cats B, C, D, E, and so on, nested like dolls in ever tinier hats. With this pack of felines, Sally and her brother may get rid of those stains, but they'll likely never be rid of that rascally cat. As should be expected from the good doctor, <I>The Cat in the Hat Comes Back</I> provides an excellent reader (and alphabet primer) for those just learning, not to mention ample laughs for everyone else.

Baloney needs to come up with a very good, very  believable excuse for being late to <I>szkola</I> yet again--or he's in big  trouble with his teacher Miss Bugscuffle. But never fear! Henry has a doozy  of a story. You see, it all started when he misplaced his trusty yellow no. zz  <I>zimulis</I>. One thing led to another, and before he knew it, he was on a  <I>razzo</I> blasting off into space, where he eventually landed on the planet  Astrosus. All went well there, as the intrepid explorer entertained the Astro  guys with his funny <I>piksas</I>--until they decided Henry and his  <I>piksas</I> would be entertaining to eat. Things go on in this vein until  somehow, miraculously, Henry P. Baloney ends up back in his classroom, a  mere seven minutes late--but still one writing utensil short!<p> Trust the ultracreative author/illustrator pair, Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith  (<I>The Stinky Cheese  Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales</I>, <I>The True Story of the 3  Little Pigs!</I>, the Time Warp Trio series, and more), to mastermind a  plot this bizarre and yet somehow familiar to any school kid. Sure, Henry P.  Baloney is a cute, saucer-eyed, green alien, but he has problems just like you  and me--such as the threat of Permanent Lifelong Detention. Remarkably, as  Scieszka reports in his afterword, when he received and decoded the  transmission of this story (directly from deep space, mind you), it was written  in a combination of many Earth languages, including Finnish, Swahili,  Latvian, Esperanto, and Inuktitut (decoder included). Go figure.<p> Caldecott Honor artist Lane Smith must have spent a lot of time in detention,  doodling away the hours. His weird, wild, wonderful pictures tell at least half  the story, illustrating for readers' enlightenment just what a <I>zimulis</I>  ("pencil" in Latvian) or <I>speelplaats</I> (Dutch for "playground") looks  like. Fans of this ingenious pair will not be disappointed and may even make  a <I>twrf</I> (Welsh for "noise") of joy! (Ages 5 to 9) <I>--Emilie  Coulter</I><br />

There was no dessert in his lunch bag. And, on top of all that, there were lima beans for dinner and kissing on TV! <BR>This handsome new edition of Judith Viorst's classic picture book is sure to charm readers of all ages.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />"I went to sleep with gum in my mouth and now there's  gum in my hair and when I got out of bed this morning I tripped on  the skateboard and by mistake I dropped my sweater in the sink  while the water was running and I could tell it was going to be a  terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day."   <P>So begin the trials and tribulations of the irascible  Alexander, who has been earning the sympathy of readers since  1972. People of all ages have terrible, horrible days, and  Alexander offers us the cranky commiseration we crave as well as a  reminder that things may not be all that bad. As Alexander's day  progresses, he faces a barrage of bummers worthy of a country- western song: getting smushed in the middle seat of the car, a  dessertless lunch sack, a cavity at the dentist's office,  stripeless sneakers, witnessing kissing on television, and being  forced to sleep in railroad-train pajamas. He resolves several  times to move to Australia. <P> Judith Viorst flawlessly and humorously captures a child's testy  temperament, rendering Alexander sympathetic rather than whiny.  Our hero's gum-styled hair and peevish countenance are artfully  depicted by Ray Cruz's illustrations. An ALA Notable Book,  <i>Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day</i>  is a great antidote to bad days everywhere, sure to put a smile on  even the crabbiest of faces. <I>(Ages 5 to 9)</I><br />

Kate  dreams about a postcard Grandpa has sent, and the story begins. <P> Kate and Henry pilot a plane, landing on a runway of crisp bacon  strips next to a field of giant broccoli stalks and oversized  hamburgers. Passing through an orange-juice rain, they approach  the town of Chewandswallow, which "used to be a very ordinary  town, except that instead of weather, food rained down from the  sky for breakfast, lunch, and dinner." Times have changed in  Chewandswallow, and readers will love finding out how storms of  gigantic food threatened normal life until eventually the Falling  Food Company was created, sending food to hungry people around the  world. Ron Barrett's comical, detailed ink-and-watercolor  illustrations and the lively story make this a satisfying sequel  to a delicious classic. <i>Pickles to Pittsburgh</i> is an  excellent bedtime book--just keep a snack handy! <I>(Ages 4 to  8)</I><br />

Beginning at  the famous Seahorse Cafe, social hub of the Old Reef, The Sign of the  Seahorse takes us on a great journey. We travel from the doomed coral  gardens of Reeftown to a sunken wreck and an underwater junkyard, across  the barren expanse of the Withered Plain, and into the vast, uncharted  chasms of the Deep, before arriving finally at the utmost edge of the Great  Continental Shelf. Readers of all ages will delight in the rhyming text and  gloriously detailed illustrations of this undersea adventure. The  wonderfully drawn characters will capture the imagination as The Sign of  the Seahorse is enjoyed again and again.<br />

Finally, a big brown bear is followed in by a tiny brown mouse and what happens next makes for a wonderfully funny climax.<br><br>    As the story of the animals in the mitten unfolds, the reader can see Nicki in the boarders of each page, walking through the woods unaware of what is going on.<br><br>    Once again Jan Brett has created a dramatic and beautiful picture book in her distinctive style. She brings the animals to life with warmth and humor, and her illustrations are full of visual delights and details faithful to the Ukrainian tradition from which the story comes.   </div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />A Ukrainian boy named Nicki wants his grandmother Baba to knit snow-white mittens for him. She warns her grandson that a white mitten will be hard to find if he loses it in the snow, but of course he promptly does just that!  What happens next is the surprising part, as a mole takes refuge in the lost mitten, then a rabbit, then a hedgehog, an owl, a badger, and a fox.  If you think the mitten might be a wee bit stretched out at this point, just wait: "Then a big bear sniffed at the mitten. The animals were packed in tight, but the bear didn't care. He crawled in anyway." When a tiny mouse squeezes in, her whiskers tickle the bear's nose. He sneezes, and "Aaaaa-aaaaa-ca-chew!" all the animals fly out of their crocheted cave. As the mitten sails through the air, Nicki spots it, reclaims it, and takes it home to show his smiling Baba.<p> Jan Brett is the illustrator of many well-known folktales, fairy tales, and poems, such as <I>Goldilocks and the Three Bears</I> and <I>The Owl and the Pussycat</I>, by Edward Lear. Her special signature in her detailed artwork is the intricate borders, seen in this book as birch-bark panels with embroidered details and mitten-shaped vignettes offering additional insights into the story line. Brett is at her best when she illustrates animals, and the expressions on the faces of her creatures are a delight. She carefully researched the costumes, furniture, and house in this traditional Ukrainian tale--all are authentic. A fine story to read on a frosty night with a cup of hot chocolate, and if you ever get your fill of <I>The Mitten</I>, you can always try its delightfully original companion book, <I>The Hat</I>, winner of the 1998 Boston Globe-Horn Book Award.

The house has an expressive face of windows and doors, and even the feelings of a person, so she’s sad when she’s surrounded by the dirty, noisy city’s hustle and bustle: “She missed the field of daisies / and the apple trees dancing in the moonlight.” Fortunately, there’s a happy ending, as the house is taken back to the country where she belongs. A classic!</div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />"Once upon a time there was a Little House way out in the country. She  was a pretty Little House and she was strong and well built." So begins Virginia  Lee Burton's classic <I>The Little House,</I> winner of the prestigious Caldecott Medal  in 1943. The rosy-pink Little House, on a hill surrounded by apple trees, watches the days  go, by from the first apple blossoms in the spring through the winter snows. Always  faintly aware of the city's distant lights, she starts to notice the city encroaching on her  bucolic existence. First a road appears, which brings horseless carriages and then trucks  and steamrollers. Before long, more roads, bigger homes, apartment buildings, stores, and  garages surround the Little House. Her family moves out and she finds herself alone in  the middle of the city, where the artificial lights are so bright that the Little House can no  longer see the sun or the moon. She often dreams of "the field of daisies and the  apple trees dancing in the moonlight." Children will be saddened to see the lonely,  claustrophobic, dilapidated house, but when a woman recognizes her and whisks her back  to the country where she belongs, they will rejoice. Young readers are more likely to be  drawn in by the whimsical, detailed drawings and the happy ending than by anything  Burton might have been implying about the troubling effects of urbanization. <I>(Ages 3  to 6)</I><br />

News doesn't  get better than that. Kay Thompson first wrote <I>Eloise Takes a Bawth</I> in  Italy in the 1960s with Hilary Knight and pal Mart Crowley; it has been  marinating until now for a release with all-new drawings by Hilary Knight. Of  course, this time Eloise is not in Moscow, not in Paris, she is simply in the  bawth at home in the Plaza Hotel. With Eloise, though, nothing is simple.  Perhaps especially the notion of taking a bath, where you have to "skibble into  the bathroom and take off all your clothes," then strike a pose and look in the  mirror, and splawsh, and sing, and bathe with turtle Skipperdee and dog Weenie.  And pretend to be the "loosest cannonball in all the Caribbean" and "Little Miss  Mermaid but let's keep that between us." But what's this? Could Eloise's  bathtime shenanigans be causing a drip that "has begun to drop within the walls  and hallowed halls of the stately old Plaza?" Drenching the elite at the  Venetian Masked Ball in the Grawnd Ballroom, no less? Fabulously decadent scenes  of Eloise enacting wild battles and undersea dives in the bathtub on the "tip  top floor" of the Plaza contrast deliciously with the resulting swampy splendor  of the ballroom. Extended fold-out cross-sections of the hotel's plumbing system  and a spectacular, colorful, double gatefold illustrating the underwater ball  ("the sensation of the social season" thanks to Eloise!) add drama and silliness  as well. A splawsh indeed! (Ages 6 to 106) <I>--Karin Snelson</I><br />

One by one, many of the seeds are lost-burned by the sun, fallen into the ocean, eaten by a bird. But some survive the long winter and come spring, sprout into plants, facing new dangers-trampled by playing children, picked as a gift for a friend. Soon only the tiniest seed remains, growing into a giant flower and, when autumn returns, sending its own seeds into the wind to start the process over again. 

Eric Carle's eloquent text and brilliant collages turn the simple life cycle of a plant into an exciting story, a nature lesson, and an inspiring message of the importance of perseverance.<br />

But her parents don't listen. When the wolves finally take over the house and Lucy and her family are evicted to live in the garden her parents realise perhaps they should have listened. But Lucy is no shrinking violet and pretty soon she has the wolves out and the family back in the house. So what was that noise Lucy heard coming from behind the wall...? A brilliant, witty and inventive picture book with cutting-edge art, which is sure to be a hit with existing fans of Neil Gaiman as well as young readers.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Truth be told, Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean's picture book <I>The Wolves  in the Walls</I> is terrifying. Sure, the story is fairytale-like and  presented in a jaunty, casually nonsensical way, but it is absolutely  the stuff of nightmares. Lucy hears wolves hustling, bustling,  crinkling, and crackling in the walls of the old house where her family  lives, but no one believes her. Her mother says it's mice, her brother  says bats, and her father says what everyone seems to say, "If the  wolves come out of the walls, it's all over." Lucy remains convinced, as is her beloved pig-puppet, and her worst fears are confirmed when the wolves actually do come out of the walls.<p> Up to this point, McKean's illustrations are spectacular, sinister  collages awash in golden sepia tones evocative of the creepy beauty in  <I>The City of Lost  Children</I>. The wolves explode into the story in scratchy  pen-and-ink, all jaws and eyes. The family flees to the cold, moonlit  garden, where they ponder their future. (Her brother suggests, for  example, that they escape to outer space where there's "nothing but  foozles and squossucks for billions of miles.") Lucy wants to live in  her own house...and she wants the pig-puppet she left behind.<p> Eventually she talks her family into moving back into the once-wolfish  walls, where they peek out at the wolves who are watching their  television and spilling popcorn on slices of toast and jam, dashing up  the stairs, and wearing their clothes. When the family can't stand it anymore, they burst forth from the walls, scaring the wolves, who shout, "And when the people come out of the walls, it's all over!" The wolves flee and everything goes back to normal...until the tidy ending when Lucy hears "a noise that sounded exactly like an elephant trying not to sneeze." Adult fans of this talented pair will revel in the quirky story and its darkly gorgeous, deliciously shadowy trappings, but the young or faint of heart, beware! (Ages 9 and older) <I>--Karin Snelson</I><br />

Dazzling illustrations and inspiring verse bring to life many famous moments in our country's history and reveal fascinating facts about one of its most enduring symbols. From Publishers Weekly Strike up the band and prepare to salute-this patriotic picture book unabashedly celebrates the Stars and Stripes. In a series of earnest verses, Ryan (One Hundred Is a Family) introduces young readers to our national symbol and the ideals for which it stands ("Americans stand together/ Before ceremonies start/ And promise their allegiance/ With their hands across their hearts"), while prose insets offer historical tidbits in a sidebar format. The book's clean, airy layout contrasts with Masiello's (The Extinct Alphabet Book) intense, sometimes murkily-hued oil paintings, which echo Ryan's text in their solemnity and fervor. Nonetheless, the result should delight Yankee Doodle dandies everywhere, and could help spark discussion on the basic elements of democracy. All ages.

Young readers will love the mother duck's proud, loving protection of her wee webbed ones, and those with fond memories of Boston will enjoy familiar locales, from Beacon Hill to Louisburg Square, and over the Charles River--often from a duck's-eye view. Robert McCloskey, creator of <I>Blueberries for Sal</I>, never fails to elicit happy story-time giggles from youngsters, and his soft, brown-toned, Caldecott-winning illustrations make this gentle world come alive. (Ages 3 to 8) <I>--Karin Snelson</I><br />

Told and pictured from a dog's point of view, this bright little book makes you want to kick up your heels and be a dog for a day!<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />No one, but no one, knows how to have fun like a dog does. Every month  of the year, in rain, sun, wind, or cold, dog days are full of joy and adventure. In this cheerful book of poems, a fuzzy yellow canine narrator bounds through the pages, sharing the delights and perils that a typical dog might encounter from January to December: <blockquote> "How sweet to be a dog in May,<br> And garden every single day.<br> I dig up dirt, I dig up stones,<br> And plant a row of lovely bones." </blockquote> Wacky wordsmith Jack Prelutsky's simple, childlike rhymes are perfectly paired with Dyanna Wolcott's lively, wild perspectives on dogs, people, umbrellas, and buses--all exuding a happy naiveté. Sharp-eyed readers will enjoy picking out the subtle touches in the illustrations--the dog among sheep, the runaway baby buggy with three dalmatians inside, and the Halloween witch hats lurking in the bushes. An irresistible treat for readers any time of the year. (Click to see a sample spread.) (Ages 3 to 7) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I><br />

Now, this beautiful 20th anniversary edition, with a foil cover and a heartfelt note from Jan herself, makes a perfect introduction for new fans to this cherished yuletide story.<p> Featuring the wintry northern setting and the border illustrations that have become a hallmark of Jan's work, readers will love watching Teeka's humorous attempts to control the rambunctious reindeer in time for their Christmas run.<br><br></p></div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />"Teeka was excited. And a little afraid. This year Santa had asked her  to get the reindeer ready to fly on Christmas Eve." Teeka, an Arctic girl who lives "in the shadow of Santa's Winterfarm," knows it will be a struggle to round up the reindeer who'd roamed wild on the tundra since last Christmas. Reindeer training is not easy for the hard-working young girl: "Teeka looked at the tangled reindeer, once so bold and free, and began to cry. 'It's my fault,' she said. 'I've spent all my time yelling at you, instead of helping. I'm sorry.' And one by one she gave each reindeer a hug." On December 24, Teeka--who's finally learned how to be a gentle, effective trainer--brings her antlered team to meet Santa and all the elves who have loaded the sleigh. Teeka is asleep on the last page of the book, as Santa and his well-trained reindeer--Bramble, Heather, Windswept, Lichen, Snowball, Crag, Twilight, and Tundra--fly past her window for a night of magical surprises.

Here is the story of a family whose dreams carry them beyond the drab mining town where they live to the promise of a finer life--a life of music and dance and travel. Jane Dyer's exquisite illustrations capture the song's warm feelings, making this a book for fathers and children to share and treasure. Lyrics and music are included. Full color illustrations.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />American folk singer Judy Collins's work as a lyricist is not well known, but it's as affecting as her performances of "Suzanne" and "Chelsea Morning" (for which first daughter Chelsea Clinton is said to be named). "My Father" has a special place in the hearts of those who've been lucky enough to share dreams with their own dads. A simple remembrance of an Ohio miner and his promise to take his girls to Paris, the song is now a book, and its lyrics (and score) are available to a new generation. The lyrics are accompanied here by Jane Dyer's evocative illustrations, to which children will respond immediately. Adults may even find themselves longing for their childhood days. (The publisher suggests the book for children ages 4-8, but anybody who ever loved a dad, and any dad who ever loved his children, will be moved and pleased by this book.)  <br />

But the peace of their idyllic fishing spot is often marred by the appearance of Peter Troop and his daddy. Peter is up-jumpy and loud, scaring the fish away. And the Troops harbor some resentment toward them, too. Peter and his daddy are fishing for food; Reenie and Mama fish for fun. The Troops are white; Reenie and Mama are black. And in the Jim Crow South, it is this last difference that is most significant. One day, when the Troops' fishing reel breaks, Reenie overcomes their mutual fear and mistrust to help Peter-an act that holds the promise of friendship and understanding. This is a moving story about two children crossing boundaries of race, class, and gender, and about small acts that make a big difference.<br />

Poet Reeve Lindbergh--daughter of aviator Charles Lindbergh and poet Anne Morrow Lindbergh--has gently respun part of this work in the stunning picture book The Circle of Days. A celebration of air, water, fire, earth, and life itself, this mesmerizing hymn begins, "Lord, we offer thanks and praise / For the circle of our days. / Praise for radiant brother sun, / Who makes the hours around us run." We take our hats off to artist Cathie Felstead, illustrator of A Caribbean Dozen, who with watercolor, gouache, and collage, has created some of the most breathtaking land, sky, and seascapes we've ever seen. With a remarkable use of color and cut paper, we witness the change of seasons, the scuttling of crabs, a skyful of fireworks, and moonlit cows. As an artist, she says she responded to the simple poem because, "Saint Francis took pleasure in the world with a childlike directness. He is the kind of saint whose words reach out to everyone." Youngsters will be soothed by the simple rhythm of the poem, and there's no better way to celebrate the wonders of our planet than with the graceful beauty of Felstead's unforgettable paintings.

In his latest book, <i>The Leaf Men</i>, things get even stranger, as the reader is plunged into the teeming mysterious world of an old woman's garden. When the old lady falls ill, and her garden falls into disorder, the mythical Leaf Men must be called upon to vanquish the evil Spider Queen and return things to order. Arachnid rights groups may quarrel with the choice of the spider as the villainess, but just about everyone else will marvel at Joyce's invention and his weird, detailed paintings.<br />

A "fabulous book of easy words, exciting pictures and inviting rhythm."--<i>Elementary English.  </i> <br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />"Did you ever fly a kite in bed? Did you ever walk with ten cats on your head?" Such are the profound, philosophical queries posed in this well-loved classic by Theodor "Dr. Seuss" Geisel. While many rhymes in this couplet collection resemble sphinx-worthy riddles, Seuss's intention is clear: teach children to read in a way that is both entertaining and educational. It matters little that each wonderful vignette has nothing to do with the one that follows. (We move seamlessly from a one-humped Wump and Mister Gump to yellow pets called the Zeds with one hair upon their heads.) Children today will be as entranced by these ridiculous rhymes as they have been since the book's original publication in 1960--so amused and enchanted, in fact, they may not even notice they are learning to read! <I>(Ages 4 to 8)</I><br />

A peddler walks around selling caps from a tall, tottering pile on his head. Unable to sell a single cap one morning, he walks out into the countryside, sits down under a tree, checks that all the caps are in place, and falls asleep. When he wakes up, the caps are gone--and the tree is full of cap-wearing monkeys. His attempts to get the caps back generate the kind of repetitive rhythm that 3- and 4-year-olds will adore.

The little girl wears it to school proudly, and when the other children laugh, she gives them a quick lesson about what it means to be rich.  Judith Sutton's beautiful paintings bring one of Dolly Parton's best-loved songs to life. "The heartfelt verses are imbued with the same genuine, infectiously likeable spirit Parton herself projects."'Publishers Weekly.</p><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />The rolling hills of Tennessee farmland, framed in lovely patchwork quilt patterns, set the stage for Dolly Parton's (of Grand Ol' Opry fame) warm childhood memories. The text comes directly from Parton's autobiographical hit country and western song of the same name. Perhaps the grammar is imperfect, but what C&W song ain't rife with grammatical errors--it's part of the vernacular. The story centers on a poor, but happy and loving, family (yes, they do exist) who find clever ways to deal with their poverty. As winter approaches, Mama sews a coat for her daughter from a box of scraps that someone has given her. Of course her classmates make fun of her for having a coat made of rags. But sticks and stones...  "And although we had no money / I was rich as I could be / in my coat of many colors / that Mama made for me." That doesn't mean the child's feelings aren't hurt, or that she didn't feel angry. But the message comes through loud and clear (like Parton's voice): the child's mother has provided her with the strength to deal with other children's jeers, and family love can sometimes be enough to pull a person through.<br />

These men of vision, brought to life in the majestic paintings of artist Kadir Nelson, lived at a time when the color of their skin dictated where they could live, what schools they could attend, and even where they could sit on a bus or in a movie theater. <BR> Yet in the face of this tremendous adversity, these dedicated souls and others like them not only demonstrated the importance of Black culture in America, but also helped issue in a movement that "changed the world." Their lives and their works inspire us to this day, and serve as a guide to how we approach the challenges of tomorrow.<br />

Well, not this Gingerbread Baby in a delicious twist to a favorite old tale.</p>   <p>It all begins when Matti opens the oven too soon and out jumps a cheeky little Gingerbread Bay. He leads Matti's mother and father, the dog and the cat. And a whole colorful cast of characters on a rollicking chase through the village and into the forest, staying just out of reach, daring them to catch him along the way.</p>   <p>But Matti's not with them. He's at home in the borders making what turns out to be a gingerbread house into which the Gingerbread Baby runs.  Only Matti knows he is safely inside. And readers will too when they look under the lift-the-flap gingerbread house at the end of the story, and there he is!</p>        </div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br /><blockquote> <I>"I am the Gingerbread Baby,<br> Fresh from the pan.<br> If you want me,<br> Catch me if you can!"</I> </blockquote> That sassy cookie! When Matti opens the oven door just a little too soon, out pops a gingerbread baby instead of the gingerbread boy he was expecting. Eluding all efforts to catch him, the flat, becandied baby is chased around the village and into the countryside. He mercilessly taunts Matti's parents, a cat, the milk and cheese man, goats, villagers, a fox, and more. In a less traumatic twist on the classic Gingerbread Boy story, this Gingerbread Baby even outfoxes the fox. Sure he's bratty, but he doesn't deserve the gruesome end the Gingerbread Boy usually comes to. Matti makes sure this naughty but appealing little one ends up right where he belongs.<p> This fresh-baked version of the traditional nursery story is brought to you from the creative and award-winning ovens of Jan Brett. Best known for such favorites as <I>The Mitten</I> and <I>The Hat</I>, she has illustrated many other familiar folktales. Her intricately detailed paintings, with their pretty, illuminated borders, are a  perfect fit for the Swiss mountainside setting of this cozy old tale. And don't miss the Gingerbread Baby plush!

Or marvelous? Victor Vulture, Crocodila Jones, and their friends demonstrate the right -- and wrong -- things to say and do in this humorous guide to proper manners. The correct answer to each manners question is hidden in the picture. With hilarious artwork and many hidden animals to challenge sharp-eyed readers, this is a fun -- and surprising -- way to learn manners.  "Part Emily Post and part I Spy game, this humorous guide to basic etiquette painlessly provides plenty of solid information on societal do's and don'ts."  -- <i>Publishers Weekly</i>  <br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />When a crocodile is eating an armadillo, should she put her napkin (a) on her head, (b) in her ear, or (c) on her lap? If you can't figure out the answer to this silly etiquette quiz, peer into the color-rich full-page illustration, where you'll find the subtly hidden letter c. Each page of this delightful book poses one or two quiz questions, designed to test whether your child's manners are monstrous or marvelous. When Mother Cobra is busy talking to Mrs. Python, for example, how should Cory Cobra get her attention? Should he (a) hiss, (b) eat a rabbit, or (c) wait quietly? No doubt your child will answer "Hiss" and then erupt into giggles, but will know that (sigh) "Wait quietly" is probably the real answer. Caralyn and Mark Buehner--creators of <I>A Job for Wittilda</I> and <I>The Escape of Marvin the Ape</I>--have succeeded again with this lighthearted alternative to the usual persistent parental nudging. <I>(Ages 4 to 8)</I><br />

Little Frog tells her she's not looking long enough, and he's right.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Goethe (1749-1832) is celebrated as a great German poet, novelist, and philosopher. But in his eyes, color theory was his most significant achievement. In 1810 Goethe published <I>Farbenlehre</I>, naming three primary colors--red, blue, and yellow--from which all other colors could be made, and claiming that each color had an opposite, or complementary, color. But how does this relate to well-loved artist Eric Carle's <I>Hello, Red Fox</I>? Well, it's like this. On his special birthday, Little Frog's friends--Red Fox, Purple Butterfly, Orange Cat, and others--begin to arrive at his house for a party. Imagine Mama Frog's surprise when she perceives Red Fox as green, Purple Butterfly as yellow, and so on.  Each time, Little Frog gently points out that she simply hasn't stared at each animal long enough to see his or her "true color."<p> At the beginning of the book, readers are instructed to stare for ten seconds at the boldly colored animal on the left side of the spread, then transfer their unblinking gaze (more like glaze at this point) to the blank white page on the right. If they do that successfully, a shadowy image of the animal appears in its complementary color! Young kids may think this is magic, but actually the phenomenon taking place between the eye and the brain is called "simultaneous contrast after-image." No matter what you call it, it's amazing and fun to behold! The story itself is simple and deliberately repetitive, appealing to very young children, but the optical illusions will be a hit with all ages. Carle's bold collage illustrations are perfect for this playful spin around the color wheel, which ends with the green Little Frog turning red when Mama Frog kisses him in front of all of his friends. (Ages 4 to 8). <I>Karin Snelson</I><br />

From the first moments of life, she is able to breathe, to open her eyes, and to gaze at her mother's face. Soon she will nurse, suck her thumb, and sleep. In HAPPY BIRTH DAY!, Robie H.

She said, "I don't go to bed yet. I am a BIG GIRL."</i><br><br>Humphrey is busy getting ready for bed, but Lottie has far more important things to do. She has to take care of her stuffed animals and make sure they are ready for bed. Luckily, Lottie is a big girl, so she gets to stay up very, very late. But it's hard work getting all those babies ready for bed, and even big girls get tired sometimes. <br><br>Humphrey, the endearing toddler from <i>Humphrey's Corner</i>, is back. In this charming companion book readers meet Humphrey's big sister, Lottie, and a familiar bedtime ritual takes on a whole new meaning.<br></div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />The great thing about being big (as every older sibling knows and  flaunts) is that you get to stay up later than your younger brothers and  sisters. On the other hand, staying up late isn't always all it's cracked up to  be. Adorable little elephant Humphrey, whom we met in <I>Humphrey's Corner</I>, looks on in  bemusement as his big sister Lottie gloats over her privileges: "I don't go to  bed yet. I am a BIG GIRL." Humphrey has a lovely time in his bath, enjoys a hot  milk and buttery toast supper, and gets all snuggly and sleepy as his mother  reads him his favorite fairy tale. Meanwhile, Lottie, who has declined all  bedtime rituals, is becoming hot and cranky.<p> Sally Hunter's pastel-colored pencil and watercolor illustrations are filled  with details of a cozy home life, while her simple, toddler-like text depicts  the sometimes complicated desires of children. Bed-shy kids will see bedtime in  an entirely new light, whether they identify with Lottie or Humphrey. (Ages 3 to  6) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I><br />

Meanwhile, Adam Krupp wakes up, Brenda Heath brushes her teeth, and Christopher Beaker finds his sneaker. Miss Bindergarten puts the finishing touches on the room just in time, and the students arrive. Now the fun can begin! This rhyming, brightly illustrated book is the perfect way to practice the alphabet and to introduce young children to kindergarten.<br><br>"Multifaceted and appealing, this book can be enjoyed in many ways, at home and at school."<br>-<b>The New York Times Book Review</b></div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />On the first day of kindergarten, Miss Bindergarten must prepare her classroom for her beloved students. This noble, whimsical teacher greets her dark, summertime-empty classroom with an explosion of color--a bouquet of fall leaves, a goldfish, rolled-up posters, and shoeboxes full of no-doubt-delightful surprises. Meanwhile, her young students get ready, too: "<B>A</B>dam Krupp wakes up. <B>B</B>renda Heath brushes her teeth. <B>C</B>hristopher Beaker finds his sneaker." Author Joseph Slate matches each animal character with a letter of the alphabet, and readers can flip to the back to discover that Adam is an alligator, Brenda is a beaver, and Christopher is a cat--and so on, through the more obscure animals such as the quokka and the Uakari monkey. Youngsters will relish the scenes of school preparation, adorned by rhyming text: a mother iguana dragging her son Ian Lowe (who cries "I won't go!") out the front door, and the little vole Vicki Densel biting her pencil. And of course Miss Bindergarten is the kindergarten teacher we either remember fondly or wish we had. The final back-to-school classroom scene explodes with love and pride and the smell of freshly sharpened pencils.

Eye-catching foil stamping, glittering on every page, offers instant child appeal, but it is the universal message at the heart of this simple story about a beautiful fish who learns to make friends by sharing his most prized possessions that gives the book its lasting value. A CHRISTOPHER AWARD WINNER WINNER OF THE BOLOGNA BOOK FAIR CRITICI IN ERBA PRIZE AMERICAN BOOKSELL ABBY AWARD WINNER AN IRA-CBC CHILDREN'S CHOICE<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />If you read this very popular book just before bed, and the light is still on in the hallway, you can make the rainbow scales glitter on the page, and realize why the Rainbow Fish was so proud of his beautiful decoration. Sometimes, though, being too proud of outside beauty can blind a fish, or a child (or even, heaven forbid, a parent) to the beauty people hold inside. That's the lesson of this simple tale, imported from Switzerland. It's a useful one for future sneaker and designer clothing shoppers, for rainbow fish--and for quieter, plainer minnows, too.<br />

How did it get there? "Waves carried it up in a storm," says an old sailor. But is it possible that waves could ever get that high? There is another story -- the story of a boy and his obsessive desire to be the greatest sailor, the story of a storm that carried the boy and his boat to a place where boats glide like gulls high above the water and not upon it. Chris Van Allsburg tells that story of the boy and his boat, the Zephyr, in words and haunting, full-color pastel paintings. His sailboats sail the night sky with the stars in pictures so vivid that the reader can almost hear the wind in the sails. Here is a work of unusual artistry that will enchant readers of all ages for many years to come.</div><br />

He has to endure gum in his hair, sitting in the middle of the backseat, third-best-friend status, no dessert at lunch, lima beans, railroad pajamas, and kissing on TV—all in one day! Maybe he’ll just move to Australia.<BR> <BR>Now available as an oversize board book edition—the perfect size for a lap—this funny and endearing story that has delighted readers for more than forty years includes artwork that showcases Alexander (and only Alexander) in full color, underscoring the comic misery of his awful day.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />"I went to sleep with gum in my mouth and now there's  gum in my hair and when I got out of bed this morning I tripped on  the skateboard and by mistake I dropped my sweater in the sink  while the water was running and I could tell it was going to be a  terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day."   <P>So begin the trials and tribulations of the irascible  Alexander, who has been earning the sympathy of readers since  1972. People of all ages have terrible, horrible days, and  Alexander offers us the cranky commiseration we crave as well as a  reminder that things may not be all that bad. As Alexander's day  progresses, he faces a barrage of bummers worthy of a country- western song: getting smushed in the middle seat of the car, a  dessertless lunch sack, a cavity at the dentist's office,  stripeless sneakers, witnessing kissing on television, and being  forced to sleep in railroad-train pajamas. He resolves several  times to move to Australia. <P> Judith Viorst flawlessly and humorously captures a child's testy  temperament, rendering Alexander sympathetic rather than whiny.  Our hero's gum-styled hair and peevish countenance are artfully  depicted by Ray Cruz's illustrations. An ALA Notable Book,  <i>Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day</i>  is a great antidote to bad days everywhere, sure to put a smile on  even the crabbiest of faces. <I>(Ages 5 to 9)</I><br />

As absurd and amusing as ever."--Chicago Tribune.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />One day Pepito, son of the Spanish ambassador who lives next door to Madeline, invites her and her cohorts to a Gypsy carnival. They venture forth excitedly, but suddenly a storm hits the fairgrounds, so everyone hops in a taxi and heads back home. Except for Madeline and Pepito, that is--forgotten and stuck at the top of a Ferris wheel in a downpour. Pepito climbs down to get help, and the Gypsy Mama takes the children under her wing ... and on the road. Gypsy life affords many previously forbidden wonders to the two kids--they get to float in a pool while everyone else is in school, and they don't have to brush their teeth, or even sleep. In between learning how to walk the tightrope and juggling, they send Miss Clavel a postcard. "'Thank heaven,' she said, 'The children are well! / But dear, oh dear, they've forgotten how to spell.'" As she and Madeline's 11 classmates race to find them (based on the postmark location), the Gypsy Mama sees the approaching Parisian posse in her crystal ball. Despite the Gypsy Mama's worst intentions, and the fact that she sewed the children into an old lion's costume to hide them, Madeline and Pepito are reunited with Miss Clavel and the others. The <I>Chicago Tribune</I> writes, "How inevitable that the irrepressible Madeline should one day meet up with gypsies....  As absurd and amusing as ever." (Ages 4 to 8) <I>--Karin Snelson</I><br />

And they wondered just what was in store.<br>Would this be a good year?<br>Would school be a bore?<br><br>Everyone remembers feeling excited and nervous each fall on the first day of school. It's no different for Ellie McSnelly and Carrie O'Toole. But this year, there's not only a new teacher to meet, but a brand new kid as well. Lazlo S. Gasky doesn't look or speak quite like the other kids, and no one is sure what to make of him. In fact, they respond to his arrival at Brookhaven School by taunting and teasing him. But when Ellie realizes how tough it is for Lazlo, she reaches out, and after school one day they share an afternoon of soccer, strudel, and chess. Besides making a new friend, she and Lazlo teach their classmates an important lesson-one that isn't in their schoolbooks-about accepting people who are different...and in getting to know Lazlo, the kids learn that people aren't that different from each other after all.<br><br>From one of America's most respected journalists, <b>The Brand New Kid</b> is a heartwarming story about tolerance and the need to give others a chance that will entertain and inspire children and adults alike.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />On Ellie and Carrie's first day of second grade there's a brand new kid  in the class. But when the teacher asks her students to welcome the ultrablond,  blue-eyed, pink-lipped, loud-voiced, accent-sporting Lazlo S. Gasky to  Brookhaven School, they all mock him instead: "Too different and strange to fit  in they all feared." Lazlo grows unhappier by the minute, as he is ostracized  and taunted by his classmates. One day, however, when Ellie sees his sad-looking  mother walking forlornly toward her car ("Her son's having trouble, she might  pull him out, / this school may be wrong for him, she's full of doubt"), things  begin to look up for Lazlo. At that moment Ellie begins to wonder what it must  be like to be a new kid, feeling so "different and strange," and she decides to  take steps to get to know him, even at the risk of facing her friends' ridicule.  ("At school the next day the kids stopped her and said, / 'You were walking with  Lazlo, are you sick in the head?' / Ellie paused and replied, 'Now I know him,  you see, / Lazlo isn't that different from you and from me.'" <p> NBC News' <I>Today</I> coanchor Katie Couric's rhyming book provides a healthy  approach to treating people who may be perceived as different, and works well as  a springboard to discussion. Though the suddenness of Ellie's turnaround in  attitude seems a bit unnatural and the rhymes are often forced ("They arrived at  his door greeted by his French poodle / and Mrs. Gasky was there with a plate of  warm strudel!"), the message of <I>The Brand New Kid</I> will certainly not be  lost on children. As Couric writes in her introduction, "It sometimes takes  courage, but I hope this story will inspire all of us to reach out and make  someone feel a little less scared and a little less lonely." Hear, hear.  Caldecott Honor artist Marjorie Priceman's watercolor spreads are positively  delightful, washing warmly over the pages in a free, buoyant style.

Cornell's splashy colorful spreads (one  which folds out to four full pages) pop with plenty of witty details. One  balloon, for example, waits nervously with a suitcase outside the Bates Motel.  In a balloon-ridden urban scenario, advertisements promote balloon-friendly  services such as "The Detanglers, professionals since 1934." This exuberant book  will have you half-believing that balloons are people, too. Next  time your child's balloon drifts away, it'll be much easier for him or her to  imagine it dancing in Bolivia than caught up in phone wires! (Ages 4 to 8)  <em>--Karin Snelson</em></p><br />

When all the shoppers have gone home for the  night, Corduroy climbs down from the shelf to look for his missing  button. It's a brave new world! He accidentally gets on an  elevator that he thinks <I>must</I> be a mountain and sees the  furniture section that he thinks must be a palace. He tries to  pull a button off the mattress, but he ends up falling off the bed  and knocking over a lamp. The night watchman hears the crash,  finds Corduroy, and puts him back on the shelf downstairs. The  next morning, he finds that it's his lucky day! A little girl buys  him with money she saved in her piggy bank and takes him home to  her room. Corduroy decides that this <I>must</I> be home and that  Lisa must be his friend.

Muth deftly capture the magnificence of a sudden rainstorm on a swelteringly hot day. Much more than a simple tale of weather, <I>Come On, Rain!</I> also portrays the tenderness of mother-daughter relations, the rhythms of urban society, and the power of nature to transform and reinvigorate all forms of life.<p> The book's collaborators, more like alchemists, work wonders. Muth's sunbaked watercolors perfectly  convey the washed-out, drought-stricken world, while Hesse's gripping narrative--a detailed prose poem written in the voice of the watchful, pigtailed Tessie--conveys undaunted hope and anticipation. Like a long-limbed little bird--all twiggy arms and legs--Tessie moves through the neighborhood, observing her Mamma, her friends, the skies, even the streets: <blockquote> Up and down the block,<br> cats pant,<br> heat wavers off tar patches in the broiling alleyway....<p> I stare out over rooftops,<br> past chimneys, into the way off distance.<br> And that's when I see it coming,<br> clouds rolling in,<br> gray clouds, bunched and bulging under a purple sky. <p> A creeper of hope circles round my bones.<br> "Come on, rain!" I whisper.<br> </blockquote> As the downpour approaches, Tessie gathers her neighborhood friends for a romp in the raindrops. Their eager anticipation is matched by a rain shower so gigantic, it even makes their mothers run into the street. It's literally the stuff that dreams are made of--my own daughter dreamed of the delicious downpour the night we first read the book. (Click to see a sample spread. Text ©1999 by Karen Hesse.

But when they and Papa set sail for America in 1950, they settle in a bustling, crowded city of tall buildings, taxicabs, and people who speak a strange language. Bram feels as empty as their empty apartment-but then their furniture arrives from Holland.

(<i>Booklist</i>, starred review)<br><br> "Kurlansky is a masterful storyteller. . . . Schindler's pictures, from serious to silly, add to the pleasure . . . . Readers of this title will never again look at fish and chips in quite the same way." (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br> "Breezy, kid-friendly prose. . . . Fascinating and informative . . . bound to hook young readers." (<i>The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books</i>)</div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Parents may have read or heard of Mark Kurlansky's runaway bestseller  <I>Cod: A Biography of the Fish That  Changed the World</I>. It's an improbably fascinating story, and here,  Kurlansky has teamed up with superb illustrator S.D. Schindler to tell it all  over again, this time for kids. The life history of the cod--driven by its  insatiable hunger--is interwoven with the insatiable hunger of people, from the  Vikings onwards. The illustrations are both informative (a cross-section of the  Continental Shelf, a map of the Atlantic) and humorous (comical New Englanders  dancing for joy at the invention of frozen fish fingers). Along the way, the  reader accidentally learns a great deal about the Vikings, the Basques, the  American Revolution, the slave trade--and the current danger, once thought  impossible, that the cod will be fished to extinction. Too chewy for children  under about 5 or 6, this is an excellent bellyful of high-protein nonfiction for  all children and even their parents. (Ages 6 to 12) <I>--Richard Farr</I><br />

Soon, their eyes open and "soon after that they learned to walk, waddling about unsteadily on their short legs, with their tails sticking up like little pine trees." One day their parents leave them alone in their box, and because kittens are prone to mischief, mischief ensues. Rugs are attacked, curtains are clawed, and yikes!--a lamp gets broken. Muff and Buster come to the rescue, and three exhausted kitties snuggle in for the night with a loving licking from Mama Muff.<p> This classic storybook, by Caldecott Honor author/illustrator Clare Turlay Newberry, was originally published in 1948 and was named one of the Fifty Books of the Year by the American Institute of Graphic Arts. Newberry's charming illustrations are some of the sweetest animal images you'll ever come across. No wonder she was known by some as "The Cat Lady."<br />

If you give him a muffin, he'll want some jam to go with it. When he's eaten all your muffins, he'll want to go to the store to get some more muffin mix. <p> In this hilarious sequel to <em> If You Give a Mouse a Cookie,</em> the young host is again run ragged by a surprise guest. Young readers will delight in the comic complications that follow when a little boy entertains a gregarious moose.</p><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />"If you give a moose a muffin, he'll want some jam to go with it." So begins the most logical silliness to be found anywhere--at least since Laura Joffe Numeroff and illustrator Felicia Bond's <I>If You Give a Mouse a Cookie</I>. Readers will follow a young boy and his voracious visitor through a series of antlered antics: jam reveries and puppet shows and big messes. It all makes perfect sense, really, once you stop to think about it. What moose <I>wouldn't</I> want to borrow a sweater when it's cold outside? And why shouldn't the loose button on the sweater remind him of his grandmother? Bond's cleverly detailed, witty illustrations perfectly complement Numeroff's deadpan style. Through just a few deft words and brush strokes, the reader gets a real sense of the unique personalities of the two characters. Children will relate easily to the full-circle reasoning of the story, while picking up the concept of cause and effect. The moral of the story? Keep plenty of muffin mix and blackberry jam in your cupboard. You never know <I>who</I> may drop by. (Great read aloud, ages 4 to 8) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I><br />

This striking oversized anniversary edition with a silver foil jacket and a fresh image of the woodland animals will attract fans old and new, and adult collectors of Jan Brett’s books.<p> Set in a snowy forest, the fun begins when, one by one, animals crawl into Nicki’s lost white mitten to get warm until the bear sneezes, sending the animals flying up and out of the mitten. On each turn of the page, Jan hints at what animal is coming next in her signature borders, inspired by Ukrainian folk art.<br><br>    </p></div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />A Ukrainian boy named Nicki wants his grandmother Baba to knit snow-white mittens for him. She warns her grandson that a white mitten will be hard to find if he loses it in the snow, but of course he promptly does just that!  What happens next is the surprising part, as a mole takes refuge in the lost mitten, then a rabbit, then a hedgehog, an owl, a badger, and a fox.  If you think the mitten might be a wee bit stretched out at this point, just wait: "Then a big bear sniffed at the mitten. The animals were packed in tight, but the bear didn't care. He crawled in anyway." When a tiny mouse squeezes in, her whiskers tickle the bear's nose. He sneezes, and "Aaaaa-aaaaa-ca-chew!" all the animals fly out of their crocheted cave. As the mitten sails through the air, Nicki spots it, reclaims it, and takes it home to show his smiling Baba.<p> Jan Brett is the illustrator of many well-known folktales, fairy tales, and poems, such as <I>Goldilocks and the Three Bears</I> and <I>The Owl and the Pussycat</I>, by Edward Lear. Her special signature in her detailed artwork is the intricate borders, seen in this book as birch-bark panels with embroidered details and mitten-shaped vignettes offering additional insights into the story line. Brett is at her best when she illustrates animals, and the expressions on the faces of her creatures are a delight. She carefully researched the costumes, furniture, and house in this traditional Ukrainian tale--all are authentic. A fine story to read on a frosty night with a cup of hot chocolate, and if you ever get your fill of <I>The Mitten</I>, you can always try its delightfully original companion book, <I>The Hat</I>, winner of the 1998 Boston Globe-Horn Book Award.

Another masterpiece from the team that created The True Story of the Three Little Pigs!<br><i>-Horn Book</i></div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />If geese had graves, Mother Goose would be rolling in hers. <I>The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales</I> retells--and wreaks havoc on--the allegories we all thought we knew by heart. In these irreverent variations on well-known themes, the ugly duckling grows up to be an ugly duck, and the princess who kisses the frog wins only a mouthful of amphibian slime. <I>The Stinky Cheese Man</I> deconstructs not only the tradition of the fairy tale but also the entire notion of a book. Our naughty narrator, Jack, makes a mockery of the title page, the table of contents, and even the endpaper by shuffling, scoffing, and generally paying no mind to structure. Characters slide in and out of tales; Cinderella rebuffs Rumpelstiltskin, and the Giant at the top of the beanstalk snacks on the Little Red Hen. There are no lessons to be learned or morals to take to heart--just good, sarcastic fun that smart-alecks of all ages will love.  <br />

Is He a wind who is never still? Is He a rock that never moves? Is He high above or here among us?<br><br>Venerable Old Turtle quitely answered: God is all of these things.<br><br>In 1992, Old Turtle burst upon the publishing world as a uniquely satisfying fable about ecology, peace, and the interconnectedness of all beigns. Few books can match the understated, universal power of its hopeful message. The beautiful repackaging Scholastic is releasing in March 2007 makes it the perfect gift book.</div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />When all of creation--trees, stones, ants, the sky, fish—-begins arguing  over who or what God is, quiet Old Turtle is the only one who has the wisdom and  ability to see beyond herself to capture the essence. The debate escalates until  Old Turtle finally speaks: "STOP!" She accepts and incorporates the beliefs of  all the creatures: "God is indeed deep," she says to the fish in the sea, "and  much higher than high," she tells the mountains. "God is gentle and powerful.  Above all things and within all things... God IS." Old Turtle, after silencing  the crowds with her understanding, makes a prediction about the appearance of a  new "family of beings" in the world. These beings, human beings, do appear, and  soon are fighting among themselves over the nature of God. It is only when  people start listening to the mountains and winds and stones and stars that they  actually begin to hear--and to heal the earth. <p> A graceful fable, with elegant, dreamlike watercolors by illustrator Cheng-Khee  Chee, Douglas Wood's modern-day classic makes a hushed but strong environmental  statement, as well as a plea for universal acceptance.

With a confident grin, he lifts his arms up and declares, "Put it all together and you've got ME!" (Baby to age 6)<br />

As absurd and amusing as ever."--Chicago Tribune.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />One day Pepito, son of the Spanish ambassador who lives next door to Madeline, invites her and her cohorts to a Gypsy carnival. They venture forth excitedly, but suddenly a storm hits the fairgrounds, so everyone hops in a taxi and heads back home. Except for Madeline and Pepito, that is--forgotten and stuck at the top of a Ferris wheel in a downpour. Pepito climbs down to get help, and the Gypsy Mama takes the children under her wing ... and on the road. Gypsy life affords many previously forbidden wonders to the two kids--they get to float in a pool while everyone else is in school, and they don't have to brush their teeth, or even sleep. In between learning how to walk the tightrope and juggling, they send Miss Clavel a postcard. "'Thank heaven,' she said, 'The children are well! / But dear, oh dear, they've forgotten how to spell.'" As she and Madeline's 11 classmates race to find them (based on the postmark location), the Gypsy Mama sees the approaching Parisian posse in her crystal ball. Despite the Gypsy Mama's worst intentions, and the fact that she sewed the children into an old lion's costume to hide them, Madeline and Pepito are reunited with Miss Clavel and the others. The <I>Chicago Tribune</I> writes, "How inevitable that the irrepressible Madeline should one day meet up with gypsies....  As absurd and amusing as ever." (Ages 4 to 8) <I>--Karin Snelson</I><br />

And they wondered just what was in store.<br>Would this be a good year?<br>Would school be a bore?<br><br>Everyone remembers feeling excited and nervous each fall on the first day of school. It's no different for Ellie McSnelly and Carrie O'Toole. But this year, there's not only a new teacher to meet, but a brand new kid as well. Lazlo S. Gasky doesn't look or speak quite like the other kids, and no one is sure what to make of him. In fact, they respond to his arrival at Brookhaven School by taunting and teasing him. But when Ellie realizes how tough it is for Lazlo, she reaches out, and after school one day they share an afternoon of soccer, strudel, and chess. Besides making a new friend, she and Lazlo teach their classmates an important lesson-one that isn't in their schoolbooks-about accepting people who are different...and in getting to know Lazlo, the kids learn that people aren't that different from each other after all.<br><br>From one of America's most respected journalists, <b>The Brand New Kid</b> is a heartwarming story about tolerance and the need to give others a chance that will entertain and inspire children and adults alike.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />On Ellie and Carrie's first day of second grade there's a brand new kid  in the class. But when the teacher asks her students to welcome the ultrablond,  blue-eyed, pink-lipped, loud-voiced, accent-sporting Lazlo S. Gasky to  Brookhaven School, they all mock him instead: "Too different and strange to fit  in they all feared." Lazlo grows unhappier by the minute, as he is ostracized  and taunted by his classmates. One day, however, when Ellie sees his sad-looking  mother walking forlornly toward her car ("Her son's having trouble, she might  pull him out, / this school may be wrong for him, she's full of doubt"), things  begin to look up for Lazlo. At that moment Ellie begins to wonder what it must  be like to be a new kid, feeling so "different and strange," and she decides to  take steps to get to know him, even at the risk of facing her friends' ridicule.  ("At school the next day the kids stopped her and said, / 'You were walking with  Lazlo, are you sick in the head?' / Ellie paused and replied, 'Now I know him,  you see, / Lazlo isn't that different from you and from me.'" <p> NBC News' <I>Today</I> coanchor Katie Couric's rhyming book provides a healthy  approach to treating people who may be perceived as different, and works well as  a springboard to discussion. Though the suddenness of Ellie's turnaround in  attitude seems a bit unnatural and the rhymes are often forced ("They arrived at  his door greeted by his French poodle / and Mrs. Gasky was there with a plate of  warm strudel!"), the message of <I>The Brand New Kid</I> will certainly not be  lost on children. As Couric writes in her introduction, "It sometimes takes  courage, but I hope this story will inspire all of us to reach out and make  someone feel a little less scared and a little less lonely." Hear, hear.  Caldecott Honor artist Marjorie Priceman's watercolor spreads are positively  delightful, washing warmly over the pages in a free, buoyant style.

Mom says it's the heat.<br />I put rouge on the cat and gloves on my feet.<br />I ate noodles for breakfast and pancakes at night.<br />I dressed like a star and was quite a sight. <p>Today I am sad, my mood's heavy and gray.<br />There's a frown on my face and it's been there all day.<br />My best friend and I had a really big fight.<br />She said that I tattled and I know that she's right.</p><p>Silly, cranky, excited, or sad--everyone has moods that can change each day. Jamie Lee Curtis's zany and touching verse, paired with Laura Cornell's whimsical and original illustrations, helps kids explore, identify, and, even have fun with their ever-changing moods.</p><p>Here's another inspired picture book from the bestselling author-illustrator team of <em>Tell Me Again About the Night I Was Born</em> and <em>When I Was Little: A Four-Year-Old's Memoir of Her Youth.</em></p><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Jamie Lee Curtis has starred in many movies, but she says that the  children's books she has written mean more to her than any of her films. She and  artist Laura Cornell have previously collaborated on two bestselling books: <I>Tell Me Again About the Night I Was Born</I> and <I>When I Was Little: A Four-Year-Old's Memoir of Her Youth</I>. This time, we follow a little girl with curly red hair through 13 different moods, beginning with silly: "Today I feel silly. / Mom says it's the heat. I put rouge on the cat / and gloves on my feet." Of course, silly soon turns to grumpy and mean... to excited... to confused, and so on. Recognizing one's own mood swings is a developmental milestone, one that some adults haven't yet mastered! Cornell's watercolor illustrations--wildly expressive and energetic--effectively capture the volatility of our redheaded star. Whether she is happy or mad or dancing a solo in jazz, she is always "full of pizzazz," and this book is, too. A clever mood wheel on the last page allows young readers to change the little girl's expression--both her eyes and mouth. This is silly fun with a smart lesson for children from ages 4 to 8. <I>--Marcie Bovetz</I><br />

The book's whimsical illustrations, reminiscent of Beatrix Potter, glow with brilliant color and are filled with fascinating detail. Each number introduces a facet of traditional Native American culture, such as Pueblo corn dances or Navajo weaving, and the simple, rhyming text is enhanced by a brief afterword on Native American customs. Ideal for storytime or bedtime, this is a book sure to leave children counting rabbits instead of sheep.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />This winner of the Parents Magazine "Best Book of the Year" award is a simple counting book that celebrates Native American culture--and rabbits, of course. Each of Sylvia Long's detailed, painterly double-page illustrations has an old-fashioned quality that gives the book the feel of classic children's literature from the turn of the century. The accompanying text is a simple, rhythmic series of rhyming couplets. "Three busy messengers sending out the news" has three rabbits using one of their blankets to send smoke signals across a grassy river valley; "Four clever trackers looking for some clues" shows intrepid little hunters with bows and arrows examining the enormous paw-print of a bear. After "Ten sleepy weavers knowing day is done," an extra panel shows one rabbit hunched over a campfire while the other nine sleep soundly. A cut above the mass of counting books. (Baby to age 4) <I>--Richard Farr</I> <br />

In the beginning, it was a harvest festivalduring which the people of Great Britain, Ireland, and northern France gave thanks for their harvested crops. Over time, Halloween took on new meaning, and people believed that elves, spirits, and scary creatures roamed the earth.</p> <p>Now Halloween is a time for children to dress in costumes and go door to door in search of treats, but some ancient traditions are still part of this festive night. Find out how this spooky celebration became a much anticipated holiday in this charming book by Carol Greene, with illustrations by Linda Bronson.</p><br />

If you give him a muffin, he'll want some jam to go with it. When he's eaten all your muffins, he'll want to go to the store to get some more muffin mix. <p> In this hilarious sequel to <em> If You Give a Mouse a Cookie,</em> the young host is again run ragged by a surprise guest. Young readers will delight in the comic complications that follow when a little boy entertains a gregarious moose.</p><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />"If you give a moose a muffin, he'll want some jam to go with it." So begins the most logical silliness to be found anywhere--at least since Laura Joffe Numeroff and illustrator Felicia Bond's <I>If You Give a Mouse a Cookie</I>. Readers will follow a young boy and his voracious visitor through a series of antlered antics: jam reveries and puppet shows and big messes. It all makes perfect sense, really, once you stop to think about it. What moose <I>wouldn't</I> want to borrow a sweater when it's cold outside? And why shouldn't the loose button on the sweater remind him of his grandmother? Bond's cleverly detailed, witty illustrations perfectly complement Numeroff's deadpan style. Through just a few deft words and brush strokes, the reader gets a real sense of the unique personalities of the two characters. Children will relate easily to the full-circle reasoning of the story, while picking up the concept of cause and effect. The moral of the story? Keep plenty of muffin mix and blackberry jam in your cupboard. You never know <I>who</I> may drop by. (Great read aloud, ages 4 to 8) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I><br />

From soaring to high heights and seeing great sights to being left in a Lurch on a prickle-ly perch, Dr. Seuss addresses life’s ups and downs with his trademark humorous verse and illustrations, while encouraging readers to find the success that lies within. In a starred review, <i>Booklist</i> notes: “Seuss’s message is simple but never sappy: life may be a ‘Great Balancing Act,’ but through it all ‘There’s fun to be done.’”<br></p><br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Inspirational yet honest, and always rhythmically rollicking, <I>Oh, the Places You'll Go!</I> is a perfect sendoff for children, 1 to 100, entering any new phase of their lives. Kindergartners, graduate students, newlyweds, newly employeds--all will glean shiny pearls of wisdom about the big, bountiful future. The incomparable Dr. Seuss rejoices in the potential everyone has to fulfill their wildest dreams: "You'll be on your way up! / You'll be seeing great sights! / You'll join the high fliers / who soar to high heights." At the same time, he won't delude the starry-eyed upstart about the pitfalls of life: "You can get all hung up / in a prickle-ly perch. / And your gang will fly on. / You'll be left in a Lurch."<p> But fear not! Dr. Seuss, with his inimitable illustrations and exhilarating rhymes, is convinced ("98 and 3/4 percent guaranteed") that success is imminent.  As long as you remember "to be dexterous and deft. And NEVER mix up your right foot with your left," things should work out. (All ages) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I><br />

Beep! Sheep in a jeep on a hill that's steep." </I></blockquote>  This story, much like the jeep, gathers momentum from page one. When five foolish sheep cram into one jeep, their high spirits and occasional lack of foresight (like forgetting to steer) combine to make a riotous, if ill-fated, road trip. Plummeting over a hill, tumbling into a mud puddle, yelping for help, these muttonheads just can't get their act together, much to the delight of young readers.<p> Nancy Shaw's Seussian rhymes are guaranteed to tickle every reader's funny bone, while providing a great little learning tool, as well. Who wouldn't want to learn how to read, after hearing lines like this: "Jeep goes splash! Jeep goes thud! Jeep goes deep in gooey mud!" Well-loved illustrator Margot Apple humorously captures the dopey expressions and preposterous predicaments of Shaw's sheep. More wild and woolly misadventures can be found in any of Shaw and Apple's other sheepish titles, including <I>Sheep on a Ship</I> and <I>Sheep Take a Hike</I>. (Ages 2 to 7) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I><br />

Only brave Madeline is up and about ... competently running the household until she hears a knock at the door--a visitor whom she suspects might be Santa Claus. Instead it is a magical-rug merchant, with 12 red carpets that Madeline thinks would be perfect for the 12 girls and "For our ice-cold in the morning feet." She procures a few francs from Miss Clavel and pays the merchant. Without his rugs, however, he is very chilly, and he feels quite silly for having sold them. He returns to the old house (still covered in vines), where Madeline helps him thaw out, and he works a little Christmas magic--sending the girls on cross-country carpet rides to surprise their parents. Of course, Miss Clavel's bell breaks the spell and they're all back in time to celebrate the New Year.  (Ages 4 to 8) <I>--Karin Snelson</I><br />

Sometimes you can see a dragon, or a flower, or an angel with flowing hair. But you don't need to look up in the sky to find angels.<P>There are angels right here on earth that we can see and feel and touch. There is one in the curve of a butterfly wing; another in the haloed head of a sunflower. Perhaps you have made an angel in the snow, or at the seashore with seaweed hair and shell wings. Nature's angels are everywhere you look. Maybe you'll find only a face in a ripple of water, or a swirling dress in a flying milkweed puff, But if you look, you'll see angels everywhere.<P>Come turn the pages and find the angels, But look carefully- they like to play hide and seek.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />"Sky, earth, / cloud, and rain, / show your face / to me again. / Halo nods, / wing unbends, / I see angels / without end." Ann Turner finds angels in the strangest places--in sunflowers, in milkweed fluff, in ponds, in clouds, and in the curve of a butterfly wing. In this boldly colorful, richly textured picture book, she--along with artist Lois Ehlert, creator of the Caldecott Honor winner <I>Color Zoo</I>--plays hide and seek with the winged celestials. In her poem "Sea Angel," an angel is built out of shells and seaweed: "We went treasure hunting / by the shore / and made a picture / on the sand / a horseshoe crab / for the head, / a scatter of shells for wings, / and a hank of green weed / for the sea angel's hair." Ehlert's painted paper collages are a pleasure to behold, even if you can't find the angel in the picture--which is likely. Artist's notes in the back offer background material on sunflowers, monarch butterflies, milkweed, and other wonders of the natural world. (Ages 5 and older) <I>--Karin Snelson</I><br />

Time for the whole family to get together to play dreidels and sing and dance. Time to remember the story of Judah Maccabee. Time to eat potato latkes. And, of course, time for presents. But most of all, it is time to light the menorahs and remember the miracle of Hanukkah. The inspiring light from the miracle of the great menorah will touch readers of all faiths as a symbol of freedom, devotion, and the joyful spirit of the holiday. A glossary is included to help readers pronounce and understand some of the words in the book. Cathy Goldberg Fishman takes young readers to a family Hanukkah celebration in her gentle text, illustrated with warmth and color by Melanie W. Hall.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />With the voice of a young girl participating in the nightly rituals of Hanukkah, Cathy Goldberg Fishman introduces children to the history and beliefs behind this eight-day Jewish celebration. Starting with the first night of Hanukkah she lights a menorah candle with the "helper candle called the <i>shammash</i>." When her mother speaks of the Assyrian soldiers who captured the Jews' Holy Temple and put out the eternal light of the menorah, the young girl thinks of the Jewish people "who fought for many years to rededicate the temple and bring the light back." Later, while playing dreidel on the seventh night, the girl's grandfather tells the story of Jews not being allowed to "celebrate our religion or read our holy books. Jews who did not want the light of our knowledge lost would still get together and study. They played the game of dreidel to disguise what they were doing." And so the family puts the menorahs in a window to be "a light of knowledge in the darkness." <p> Melanie W. Hall's soft and slightly abstract illustrations spotlight specific symbols of Hanukkah, such as potato latkes or chocolate gelt, while offering festive spreads of family cheer and togetherness.

As absurd and amusing as ever."--Chicago Tribune.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />One day Pepito, son of the Spanish ambassador who lives next door to Madeline, invites her and her cohorts to a Gypsy carnival. They venture forth excitedly, but suddenly a storm hits the fairgrounds, so everyone hops in a taxi and heads back home. Except for Madeline and Pepito, that is--forgotten and stuck at the top of a Ferris wheel in a downpour. Pepito climbs down to get help, and the Gypsy Mama takes the children under her wing ... and on the road. Gypsy life affords many previously forbidden wonders to the two kids--they get to float in a pool while everyone else is in school, and they don't have to brush their teeth, or even sleep. In between learning how to walk the tightrope and juggling, they send Miss Clavel a postcard. "'Thank heaven,' she said, 'The children are well! / But dear, oh dear, they've forgotten how to spell.'" As she and Madeline's 11 classmates race to find them (based on the postmark location), the Gypsy Mama sees the approaching Parisian posse in her crystal ball. Despite the Gypsy Mama's worst intentions, and the fact that she sewed the children into an old lion's costume to hide them, Madeline and Pepito are reunited with Miss Clavel and the others. The <I>Chicago Tribune</I> writes, "How inevitable that the irrepressible Madeline should one day meet up with gypsies....  As absurd and amusing as ever." (Ages 4 to 8) <I>--Karin Snelson</I><br />

Between getting stuck in the treetops and being chased by a crocodile, he certainly keeps Babar on his toes, but the king readily admits, “Truly it is not easy to bring up a family, but how nice the babies are!” The fifth Babar story is a wonderful and heartwarming salute to parenthood which every Mom and Dad will appreciate.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />One of Jean de Brunhoff's five original Babar stories, <I>Babar and His Children</I> tells how the royal elephant and Queen Celeste await the birth of their first child... and discover to their surprise that they have three! The loyal townsfolk bring gifts, and the babies are named before being weighed by wise Dr. Capoulosse (he of the stern expression and pince-nez).  Then it's time for young Flora, Pom, and Alexander to get into a series of scrapes and be saved by the bravery and good sense of either their parents or other animals.  Brunhoff's charming, faintly Edwardian illustrations never cease to capture the imagination, and this particular story has something in it for every member of a young family--even if some members of your family are merely human.

He lives in Colorado with his wife and frequent collaborator, Robin Page, and their children. </DIV><br/>Author: Steve Jenkins<br />Illustrator: Steve Jenkins<br />Publisher:Houghton Mifflin Books for Children<br />Published Date:05/04/2009<br />Format:Hardcover<br />0618966366<br /><br /><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Caldecott honoree Steve Jenkins offers young readers a quietly stunning story about the world below the watery surface in <em>Down, Down, Down: A Journey to the Bottom of the Sea</em>. With his incredible paper collage illustrations of sea creatures and informative text, Jenkins manages to plumbs the unfathomable depths of our oceans for the age 5-9 set in this perfect read-aloud and look closely book.  <em>Down, Down, Down</em> captures the vastness, complexity and mysteriousness of the deep without over-simplifying the new research and astonishing discoveries.  This oceanography lesson unfolds as a story in which the reader descends from the blue surface down nearly 36,000 feet (that’s seven miles down!) to the Marianas Trench, while meeting Flying Squids and Loosejaw Stoplight Fish along the way.   This is an enchanting and informative choice for kids who loved the classic illustrations of Eric Carle, Lois Ehlert and Leo Lionni as pre-schoolers, but are ready to bump up to a nonfiction read.  Children’s book collectors will surely want to get their hands on <em>Down Down Down</em>, too.   <em>--Lauren Nemroff</em><br /><br />  <hr class="bucketDivider" size="1" /> <strong>Product Description</strong><br />Caldecott Honor-winning Steve Jenkins provides a top-to-bottom look at the ocean, from birds and waves to thermal vents and ooze. Half the earth's surface is covered by water more than a mile deep, but most of this watery world is a mystery to us. In fact, more people have stood on the surface of the moon than have visited the deepest spot in the ocean.<br /><br /> Come along as we travel down, down, down, from the surface to the bottom of the sea. Along the way you can see jellyfish that flash like a neon sign, creatures with teeth so big, they can't close their mouths, and even a squid as long as a bus, which battles to the death with a sperm whale, the largest predator on earth. It'll be a journey you won't soon forget!<br /><br />  <hr class="bucketDivider" size="1" /> <br /> <p align="left"><span class="h1"><strong>A Look Inside <em>Down, Down, Down</em></strong></span> <br /><strong>(Click on   Images to Enlarge)</strong></p> <table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody> <tr align="center" class="tiny" valign="top"> <td width="50%"> <img border="0" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/DownDownDownPg14_15_400A.jpg" /> </td> <td width="50%"> <img border="0" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/DownDownDownPg33_34_400A.jpg" /> </td> </tr> <tr align="center" class="tiny" valign="top"> <td width="50%">Soft   Bodies</td> <td width="50%">Turn   Up the Heat</td> </tr> <br /> <br /> </tbody> </table> <table> <br />  <hr class="bucketDivider" size="1" /> <br /><span class="h1"><strong>A Q&A with Steve Jenkins, Author of <em>Down, Down,   Down</em></strong></span><br /><br /><img align="right" border="0" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/SteveJenkins200.jpg" /> <strong>Q:</strong> How much research was involved in the creation of the book? <p><strong>A:</strong> Lot's--I read ten or twelve books about ocean exploration and biology, borrowed or bought dozens of   others with photos and illustrations of ocean animals, watched all of the BBC ocean-related TV productions (<em>Blue   Planet</em>, <em>Planet Earth</em>, <em>The Living Planet</em>, <em>The Life of Mammals</em>--I feel like David   Attenborough is my good friend). And of course I did a lot of internet research. So many deep-ocean discoveries are   recent, and lots of things haven't made their way into print yet, at least not into books that I could find. There   are a lot of high-quality web sites associated with universities or research organizations. One of the hardest   parts was figuring out where to do the descent, once I'd decided to do a surface to sea floor journey. I wanted the   water temperature, geology and animal life to be accurate for that specific location. Ultimately, I realized that   if we were going to go on this trip, we really had to end up in the deepest spot in the sea.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What was the most surprising thing you learned while working on <em>Down, Down, Down</em>?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Probably the thing that got me interested in the first place--the fact that we know so little about   the oceans. The longest mountain range in the world--the mid-ocean ridge, which runs for more than 40,000 miles--  was unknown until the 1960s. There are undoubtedly large, still unknown life forms in the oceans.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Which animal was the most challenging to construct?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The siphonophore--both lights on and lights off.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you think accounts for both adults' and kids' long-abiding fascination with the ocean and its   creatures?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> As a species, we are intrigued with the unknown. It's one reason we've done so well, and inhabit   almost every corner of the globe (at least where there's dry land). I think it's the fact that the ocean is at once   so inviting (think: a nice day at the beach or a pleasant sailboat trip) and so terrifying (a storm at sea; the   dark, cold depths and frightening creatures) makes it especially fascinating. And many of those deep-sea creatures   are beyond anything we'd imagined.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Are there certain things a parent/teacher/adult can do to keep the love of science alive in kids? As a   parent, what do you do to encourage that love and curiosity in your own children?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Listen to their questions, and if you don’t know the answer, look it up together. Buy lots of   nonfiction books! Or get them at the library, and read them together. Like so many things--diet, physical activity,   a love of art or music--children pay more attention to what we do than what we say. So the first step in   encouraging a love of science in children might be to cultivate an interest in it ourselves. And there is so much   going on right now, so many amazing things being discovered, that it's not hard to become interested. Our family   watches lots of nature programs, such as Richard Attenborough's BBC-produced documentaries. They are a great entry   point to natural science.</p> <p>(Photo © Tim Tucker)</p> <br />  <hr class="bucketDivider" size="1" /> <br /> </table><br />

They grow old, and even the best of them, one day, lose the power of flight.... On very rare occasions, however, a broom can lose its power without warning, and fall, with its passenger, to the earth below ... which is just what happened one cold autumn night many years ago." So begins <I>The Widow's Broom</I>, the gentle, strangely captivating book by Chris Van Allsburg, who received Caldecott medals for <i>Jumanji</i> and <i>The Polar Express</i>.<P> The story gets under way when the lonely widow Minna Shaw finds a wounded, sky-fallen witch in her vegetable garden. The witch disappears before dawn, but leaves her old, presumably defunct broom behind. Minna begins to use it around the house and finds that "it was no better or worse than brooms she'd used before." However, one morning, Minna sees the broom sweeping by itself! Opportunistically, she trains it to chop wood and fetch water.<P> When the neighbors find out about this "wicked, wicked thing" (posing as an innocent, hardworking broom), they accost the widow and demand that the broom be burned. Are they successful in separating the lonely widow and her diligently sweeping friend? This is a wonderfully suspenseful book to read aloud and young listeners will earnestly hope for the broom's survival. Still, older, wiser readers, ages 8 and older, will be swept up in the story, too.<br />

There was no dessert in his lunch bag. And, on top of all that, there were lima beans for dinner and kissing on TV! <BR>This handsome new edition of Judith Viorst's classic picture book is sure to charm readers of all ages.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />"I went to sleep with gum in my mouth and now there's  gum in my hair and when I got out of bed this morning I tripped on  the skateboard and by mistake I dropped my sweater in the sink  while the water was running and I could tell it was going to be a  terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day."   <P>So begin the trials and tribulations of the irascible  Alexander, who has been earning the sympathy of readers since  1972. People of all ages have terrible, horrible days, and  Alexander offers us the cranky commiseration we crave as well as a  reminder that things may not be all that bad. As Alexander's day  progresses, he faces a barrage of bummers worthy of a country- western song: getting smushed in the middle seat of the car, a  dessertless lunch sack, a cavity at the dentist's office,  stripeless sneakers, witnessing kissing on television, and being  forced to sleep in railroad-train pajamas. He resolves several  times to move to Australia. <P> Judith Viorst flawlessly and humorously captures a child's testy  temperament, rendering Alexander sympathetic rather than whiny.  Our hero's gum-styled hair and peevish countenance are artfully  depicted by Ray Cruz's illustrations. An ALA Notable Book,  <i>Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day</i>  is a great antidote to bad days everywhere, sure to put a smile on  even the crabbiest of faces. <I>(Ages 5 to 9)</I><br />

He likes it there, and his hosts, the Primms, like having him around--he helps young Joshua with his homework, jumps-rope with the neighborhood kids, and browses through antique shops with Mrs. Primm. Much to the affable reptile's dismay, however, he makes his neighbor's cat Loretta crazy, which in turn makes Mr. Grumps, Loretta's owner, even crazier. One day, Mrs. Primm and Lyle are shopping, when Lyle--through no real fault of his own--ends up infuriating department-store bigwig Mr. Grumps who turns red and blue and purple with rage. This unfortunate eruption lands the rollicking reptile in the Central Park zoo where Lyle fights back his crocodile tears. In an elaborate sequence of events, Lyle finds himself back with the Primms on East 88th Street, a neighborhood hero, and, startlingly, even a friend of the mistrustful cat Loretta. Bernard Waber--creator of <I>The House on East 88th Street</I>--charms young readers again with this endearing, whimsical 1965 classic, perfectly complemented by his simple, sketchy, comical illustrations. <I>(Ages 4 to 8)</I><br />

The visual images have a sense of depth and seem to invite readers into this special nighttime world."--School Library Journal, starred review. Full color. 1988 Caldecott Medal Book.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Among the greatest charms of children is their ability to view a simple activity as a magical adventure. Such as a walk in the woods late at night. Jane Yolen captures this wonderment in a book whose charm rises from its simplicity. "It was late one winter night, long past my bedtime, when Pa and I went owling." The two walked through the woods with nothing but hope and each other in a journey that will fascinate many a child. John Schoenherr's illustrations help bring richness to the countryside adventure. The book won the 1988 Caldecott Medal.<br />

Full-color illustrations.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring because of a nasty, contagious illness--even the mouse is in bed with a miserable cold. Only brave Madeline is up and about ... competently running the household until she hears a knock at the door--a visitor whom she suspects might be Santa Claus. Instead it is a magical-rug merchant, with 12 red carpets that Madeline thinks would be perfect for the 12 girls and "For our ice-cold in the morning feet." She procures a few francs from Miss Clavel and pays the merchant. Without his rugs, however, he is very chilly, and he feels quite silly for having sold them. He returns to the old house (still covered in vines), where Madeline helps him thaw out, and he works a little Christmas magic--sending the girls on cross-country carpet rides to surprise their parents. Of course, Miss Clavel's bell breaks the spell and they're all back in time to celebrate the New Year.  (Ages 4 to 8) <I>--Karin Snelson</I><br />

Since it was first published in 1939, Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel has delighted generations of children. Mike and his trusty steam shovel, Mary Anne, dig deep canals for boats to travel through, cut mountain passes for trains, and hollow out cellars for city skyscrapers -- the very symbol of industrial America. But with progress come new machines, and soon the inseparable duo are out of work. Mike believes that Mary Anne can dig as much in a day as one hundred men can dig in a week, and the two have one last chance to prove it and save Mary Anne from the scrap heap. What happens next in the small town of Popperville is a testament to their friendship, and to old-fashioned hard work and ingenuity.</div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Mike Mulligan and his steam shovel Mary Anne make quite a team. The  inseparable duo digs the great canals for the big boats to travel through, cuts through the  large mountains so trains can pass, and hollows out the deep cellars for the great  skyscrapers in the city. But the introduction of gasoline, electric, and diesel shovels  means big trouble for Mike and Mary Anne. No one wants an old-fashioned steam shovel  like Mary Anne when a modern shovel can do the digging in half the time! Forced to  travel far out of the city to look for work, Mike and Mary Anne find themselves in the  little town of Popperville. Mike and Mary Anne make a bid to dig the cellar for the new  town hall, promising the town that if they can't dig the cellar in just one day they'll accept  no payment for the job. Will Mike and Mary Anne be able to complete the job? The  whole town of Popperville turns out to watch. Virginia Lee Burton, author of such classic  children's books as <I>The Little  House</I> and <I>Katy and the  Big Snow,</I> offers a touching portrait of love and dedication while commenting  on the modernization that continuously shapes our lives. Hamilton's wonderful crayon  drawings bring Mike and the indomitable Mary Anne to life. <I>(Ages 3 to 6)</I><br />

The green sashes are laid out on the table for his father and two older brothers--all ready for them to sport in the big parade. This is all very exciting, but Jamie's family had told him he was too small to walk in the parade--too young to make it all the way up Acorn Hill. He decides to take matters (and his trusty flute) into his own small hands, and embarks on an early morning walk--all the way up Acorn Hill--with his dog Nell. What did <I>they</I> know?  Sure enough, while the village is sleeping, he traverses the parade route to the top of the hill where he greets the sun with a hearty, "A happy St. Pat's to you, sun." And, he makes it home before breakfast! While no one finds out what Jamie has done, you suspect that he may tell his family later. Kids will love the fact that Jamie climbs all the way up the hill when everyone said he couldn't. A simple but satisfying St. Patrick's Day read-aloud, and an IRA/CBC Children's Choice.

In Donald Crews's <I>School Bus</I>--written "for the buses, the riders, and the watchers"--preschoolers caught up in the whole school-bus mystique can follow the path of a school bus on its daily travels--minus the aforementioned shenanigans.

Adults reading aloud to children will be able to fill in the blanks and let kids make up their own stories within the framework of this book. Crews, creator of the Caldecott Honor book  <I>Freight Train</I>,  <I>Parade</I>, and the sturdy,  board-book edition of <I>Truck</I> has  proven himself to be an expert at conveying basic concepts to youngsters, and this book is no exception!

Babar and Celeste have had triplets. The smallest, Alexander, has a knack for getting into predicaments. Between getting stuck in the treetops and being chased by a crocodile, he certainly keeps Babar on his toes, but the king readily admits, “Truly it is not easy to bring up a family, but how nice the babies are!” The fifth Babar story is a wonderful and heartwarming salute to parenthood which every Mom and Dad will appreciate.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />One of Jean de Brunhoff's five original Babar stories, <I>Babar and His Children</I> tells how the royal elephant and Queen Celeste await the birth of their first child... and discover to their surprise that they have three! The loyal townsfolk bring gifts, and the babies are named before being weighed by wise Dr. Capoulosse (he of the stern expression and pince-nez).  Then it's time for young Flora, Pom, and Alexander to get into a series of scrapes and be saved by the bravery and good sense of either their parents or other animals.  Brunhoff's charming, faintly Edwardian illustrations never cease to capture the imagination, and this particular story has something in it for every member of a young family--even if some members of your family are merely human. (Ages 2 to 6) <I>--Richard Farr</I><br />

But when Cousin Garland dares to criticize Julius, Lilly bullies her into loudly admiring Julius as the baby of the world.</p><p>"Julius is the baby of the world," said his parents. But Lilly, his older sister, disagreed. She thought he was disgusting. She hoped he would go away. But he didn't. He stayed and stayed and stayed. Nothing her parents said or did could change Lilly's mind about Julius. But when Cousin Garland had a thing or two to say about the situation, Lilly had a change of heart.</p><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />For children who are facing the arrival of a new sibling, <I>Julius, the Baby of the World</I> makes for great biblio-therapy. At first, big sister Lilly thought it might be fun to have a new baby in the family. But when her parents repeatedly coo, "Julius is the baby of world," Lilly's mouse hackles begin to rise. Soon the jealousy is too much for her, and she embarks on a rejection campaign that is hysterically funny, but also comforting for siblings who  probably feel just as much resentment but would never go to Lilly's extremes. Kevin Henkes, creator of  <I>Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse</I> refuses to shy away from the truly powerful and sometimes dark feelings of children. Through bright watercolors and handwritten, cartoon-style dialogue, Henkes relishes Lilly's wickedness. For example, she delights in insulting her oblivious baby brother: "If you were a food, you'd be a raisin," she whispers into his crib. "If you were a number you'd be zero." When she paints an elaborate family portrait, she leaves Julius out. When she throws a tea party, guess which baby doesn't get an invitation? But when a visiting cousin starts insulting baby Julius, we discover that the flip side of Lilly's intense jealousy is an even more powerful and lasting loyalty.

Of course he immediately wants to frolic outside, but his sleepy mother reminds him that frogs are supposed to sleep all winter. "Wake up when the snow melts," she calls out from her cozy bed. But Froggy insists. So off he goes after putting on his socks--"zoop," his boots--"zup," his hat--"zat," and his scarf--"zwit." The playful sound effects are perfect for read-aloud merriment and the watercolor illustrations by Frank Remkiewicz (<I>Horrible Harry</I>) are comic-strip silly. As soon as Froggy gets outside his mother calls out to remind him to put on his pants. This, as any child knows, means laboriously pulling off all footwear. "Zwit, zat, zup, zut." Then he forgets his coat and it's more "zut, znap, zum." And then--horror of horrors!--his mother yells out in front of all his animal playmates, "Froggy, your underwear!" (Which of course elicits giggles.) Ultimately, the on- and off-again dressing is too exhausting for Froggy and he winds up right back where he belongs. Good night, Froggy.

From <i>The Cat in the Hat</i> to <i>Oh, the Places You’ll Go!</i>, his iconic characters, stories, and art style have been a lasting influence on generations of children and adults. The books he wrote and illustrated under the name Dr. Seuss (and others that he wrote but did not illustrate, including some under the pseudonyms Theo. LeSieg and Rosetta Stone) have been translated into thirty languages. Hundreds of millions of copies have found their way into homes and hearts around the world. Dr. Seuss’s long list of awards includes Caldecott Honors for <i>McElligot’s Pool</i>, <i>If I Ran the Zoo</i>, and <i>Bartholomew and the Oobleck</i>, the Pulitzer Prize, and eight honorary doctorates. Works based on his original stories have won three Oscars, three Emmys, three Grammys, and a Peabody.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />"This Fox is a tricky fox. He'll try to get your tongue in trouble." Dr. Seuss gives fair warning to anyone brave enough to read along with the Fox in Socks, who likes to play tongue-twisting games with his friend Mr. Knox. "Here's an easy game to play. Here's an easy thing to say.... New socks. Two socks. Whose socks? Sue's socks." But Mr. Fox Socks isn't about to let Knox off so easy. Soon Goo-Goose is choosing to chew chewy gluey blue goo, while tweetle beetles battle with paddles in a puddle (in case you were wondering, that's called a "tweetle beetle puddle paddle battle"). Mr. Knox gets exasperated: "I can't blab such blibber blubber! My tongue isn't made of rubber." But he catches on to the game before it's all through. One of Seuss's best, this must-read-aloud classic is guaranteed to get many giggles out of readers young and old. (Ages 4 to 8) <I>--Paul Hughes</I><br />

Solitary and solemn, it is the table where no one will ever sit. As a special gift to her Uncle John, Katie and her sisters are asked to help set the white table for dinner. As their mother explains the significance of each item placed on the table Katie comes to understand and appreciate the depth of sacrifice that her uncle, and each member of the Armed Forces and their families, may be called to give.  It was just a little white table... but it felt as big as America when we helped Mama put each item on it and she told us why it was so important. "We use a Small Table, girls," she explained first, "to show one soldier's lonely battle against many. We cover it with a White Cloth to honor a soldier's pure heart when he answers his country's call to duty." "We place a Lemon Slice and Grains of Salt on a plate to show a captive soldier's bitter fate and the tears of families waiting for loved ones to return," she continued."We push an Empty Chair to the table for the missing soldiers who are not here..." Margot Theis Raven has been a professional writer working in the fields of radio, television, magazines, newspapers, and children's books for 30 years.

As I inscribed a book to a woman in her sixties, she told me that it was the second copy she had owned, and wanted to know if she could she tell me what had happened to the first.  "Of course," I answered.</p> <p>A dozen years earlier the woman, who had no children of her own, befriended a neighbor, a boy of about seven, named Eddie.  He would often cross his driveway to visit her.</p> <p>She had a collection of picture books, which she read to him, but around the holidays, the only story he ever wanted to hear, over and over, was <i>The Polar Express</i>.  One year she offered to give him the book, but Eddie declined because he wanted to hear her read it aloud to him, which she continued to do every year until the boy and his family moved away.</p> <p>Years later the woman learned from a mutual acquaintance that Eddie had grown up and become a soldier. He was stationed in Iraq. Since Christmas was approaching, the woman decided to send him a gift box. She included candy, cookies, socks, and her old copy of <i>The Polar Express</i>. She wasn't sure what a nineteen-year-old battle-weary soldier would do with the book in an army barracks in the Middle East, but she wanted him to have it. A month later, after the holidays had passed, she received a letter from Eddie.</p> <p>He told her he was very happy to have heard from her and to get the box of gifts.  He had opened it in his barracks, just before curfew, with some of his fellow GIs already in their bunks. A soldier in the next bunk spotted the book. He knew it well from his own childhood and asked Eddie to read it. "Out loud?" he asked. "Yeah," his buddy told him.</p> <p>Eddie, quietly and a little self-consciously, read <i>The Polar Express</i>. When he'd finished and closed the book, a moment of silence passed. Then from behind him a voice called out, "Read it again," and another joined in, "Yeah, read it again," and a third added, "This time, louder." So Eddie did. </p> <p>He wrote to the woman that he'd stood up and read it to his comrades just the way he remembered she had read it to him. </p> <p>All aboard,</p> <i>Chris Van Allsburg</i><br/> </p> <br/> <hr class="bucketDivider" size="1" /> <br/> <p align="left">  <h4>Recipes and Activities to Celebrate the 25th Anniversary of <i>The Polar Express</i></h4> <br> <b>(Click on Images for the Recipe or Activity [PDF])</b> <br> </p> <b>Snacks for Santa</b> <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1"  cellpadding="1">                      <tr align="center" valign="top">                                 <th width="25%">                                    <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/XmasTreeTruck250.jpg" border="0">                                                                                                    <br/>                                 Candy Cane Sugar Cookies                                    </th>                                 <td width="25%">                   <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/SantaAndBoy250.jpg"  border="0">                                                                                                  <br/> Polar Chocolate Nougat Caramel Squares                                                                                                   <br/>                                  </td>                                     <td width="25%">                                   <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/PolarExpress250.jpg"  border="0">                                                                                                   <br/>                 Christmas Snowball Cookies                                                                                  </td>                       </tr>  </table><br/><br/> <b>Fun and Games</b> <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1"  cellpadding="1">                  <tr align="center" valign="top">                                    <th width="25%">                                                                   <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/SantasSleigh250.jpg"  border="0">                                                                                                   <br/>                                                 A <i>Polar Express</i> Word Search                                                                                   </th>                                 <td width="25%">                                                                                                    <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/BoyAtDoor250.jpg" border="0">                                                                                                   <br/>                                                 A <i>Polar Express</i> Crossword                                                                                  </td>                                 <td width="25%">                                                                                                    <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/JingleBell250.jpg" border="0">                                                                                                    <br/>                                                 A <i>Polar Express</i> Maze                                                                                  </td>                 </tr>  </table>  <br/> <hr class="bucketDivider" size="1" /> <br/> </div><br />

As I inscribed a book to a woman in her sixties, she told me that it was the second copy she had owned, and wanted to know if she could she tell me what had happened to the first.  "Of course," I answered.</p> <p>A dozen years earlier the woman, who had no children of her own, befriended a neighbor, a boy of about seven, named Eddie.  He would often cross his driveway to visit her.</p> <p>She had a collection of picture books, which she read to him, but around the holidays, the only story he ever wanted to hear, over and over, was <i>The Polar Express</i>.  One year she offered to give him the book, but Eddie declined because he wanted to hear her read it aloud to him, which she continued to do every year until the boy and his family moved away.</p> <p>Years later the woman learned from a mutual acquaintance that Eddie had grown up and become a soldier. He was stationed in Iraq. Since Christmas was approaching, the woman decided to send him a gift box. She included candy, cookies, socks, and her old copy of <i>The Polar Express</i>. She wasn't sure what a nineteen-year-old battle-weary soldier would do with the book in an army barracks in the Middle East, but she wanted him to have it. A month later, after the holidays had passed, she received a letter from Eddie.</p> <p>He told her he was very happy to have heard from her and to get the box of gifts.  He had opened it in his barracks, just before curfew, with some of his fellow GIs already in their bunks. A soldier in the next bunk spotted the book. He knew it well from his own childhood and asked Eddie to read it. "Out loud?" he asked. "Yeah," his buddy told him.</p> <p>Eddie, quietly and a little self-consciously, read <i>The Polar Express</i>. When he'd finished and closed the book, a moment of silence passed. Then from behind him a voice called out, "Read it again," and another joined in, "Yeah, read it again," and a third added, "This time, louder." So Eddie did. </p> <p>He wrote to the woman that he'd stood up and read it to his comrades just the way he remembered she had read it to him. </p> <p>All aboard,</p> <i>Chris Van Allsburg</i><br/> </p> <br/> <hr class="bucketDivider" size="1" /> <br/> <p align="left">  <h4>Recipes and Activities to Celebrate the 25th Anniversary of <i>The Polar Express</i></h4> <br> <b>(Click on Images for the Recipe or Activity [PDF])</b> <br> </p> <b>Snacks for Santa</b> <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1"  cellpadding="1">                      <tr align="center" valign="top">                                 <th width="25%">                                    <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/XmasTreeTruck250.jpg" border="0">                                                                                                    <br/>                                 Candy Cane Sugar Cookies                                    </th>                                 <td width="25%">                   <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/SantaAndBoy250.jpg"  border="0">                                                                                                  <br/> Polar Chocolate Nougat Caramel Squares                                                                                                   <br/>                                  </td>                                     <td width="25%">                                   <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/PolarExpress250.jpg"  border="0">                                                                                                   <br/>                 Christmas Snowball Cookies                                                                                  </td>                       </tr>  </table><br/><br/> <b>Fun and Games</b> <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1"  cellpadding="1">                  <tr align="center" valign="top">                                    <th width="25%">                                                                   <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/SantasSleigh250.jpg"  border="0">                                                                                                   <br/>                                                 A <i>Polar Express</i> Word Search                                                                                   </th>                                 <td width="25%">                                                                                                    <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/BoyAtDoor250.jpg" border="0">                                                                                                   <br/>                                                 A <i>Polar Express</i> Crossword                                                                                  </td>                                 <td width="25%">                                                                                                    <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/JingleBell250.jpg" border="0">                                                                                                    <br/>                                                 A <i>Polar Express</i> Maze                                                                                  </td>                 </tr>  </table>  <br/> <hr class="bucketDivider" size="1" /> <br/> </div><br />

Claude sits next to him, and he wears all the right clothes, says all the right things, and garners all the praise from his teacher and classmates. Timothy is feeling down, until he meets a girl who's having the same problem with her seatmate....  "Children will easily relate to this tale, in which humor and realism effectively mesh." --<b>Booklist</b>, starred review</div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Wearing his brand-new, mom-made sunsuit, Timothy is all set for the  first day of school. It looks like nothing can spoil this exciting moment...  until perfect Claude shows up in his jacket and tie. <p> <blockquote> "Hello!" said Timothy.<br> "Nobody wears a sunsuit on the first day of school," said Claude.<br> </blockquote> It's all downhill from here. Claude has all the right clothes, answers every  question correctly, and never has to eat lunch alone. Timothy is just about  ready to give up trying when he meets Violet, who is suffering from a similar  case of imperfection. Her problem is perfect Grace, who sings, dances, and  counts up to a thousand. Soon Timothy and Violet are falling over with the  giggles, and those first-day blues are fading fast.<p> Every school has a Claude or two, and less-than-perfect kids will be absolutely  thrilled to read about Timothy's triumph over his initial insecurities. Rosemary  Wells, author-illustrator of scads of award-winning books (<I>Bunny Cakes</I> and <I>Emily's First 100 Days of  School</I>), has provided all-new illustrations for this edition of her  classic. The expressions on Timothy's face, as he goes from innocent hopefulness  to bewilderment to crushed dismay--and finally to hiccup-y joy--are true  perfection.

When the wolf comes a-knocking and a-puffing, he blows the pigs right out of the tale and into a whole new imaginative landscape, where they begin a freewheeling adventure as they wander - and fly - through other stories, encountering a dragon and a cat with a fiddle, among others. This familiar tale will never be the same old story again.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Once upon a time three pigs built three houses, out of straw, sticks,  and bricks. Along came a wolf, who huffed and puffed... So, you think you know  the rest? Think again. With David Wiesner at the helm, it's never safe to assume  too much. When the wolf approaches the first house, for example, and blows it  in, he somehow manages to blow the pig right out of the story frame. The text  continues on schedule--"...and ate the pig up"--but the perplexed expression on  the wolf's face as he looks in vain for his ham dinner is priceless. One by one,  the pigs exit the fairy tale's border and set off on an adventure of their own.  Folding a page of their own story into a paper airplane, the pigs fly off to  visit other storybooks, rescuing about-to-be-slain dragons and luring the cat  and the fiddle out of their nursery rhyme.<p> Wiesner, Caldecott Medal recipient for <I>Tuesday</I>, and Caldecott Honor  winner for both <I>Sector 7</I>  and <I>Free Fall</I>, prefers  not to wait around until pigs fly. He gives them wings (or paper airplanes) and  sets them on their way! In his latest flight of fancy, Wiesner uses shifting  illustration styles and fonts to startle complacent readers into an imaginary  world even as they ponder the conventional structure of story. His trademark  crafty humor and skewed perspectives will tickle readers pink (even the  nonporcine variety)! (Ages 4 and older) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I><br />

Those lines have echoed through the decades, the final stanza of a poem published pseudonymously in the June 3, 1888, issue of the San Francisco Examiner. Its author would rather have seen it forgotten. Instead, Ernest Thayer's poem has taken a well-deserved place as an enduring icon of Americana. Christopher Bing's magnificent version of this immortal ballad of the flailing 19th-century baseball star is rendered as though it had been newly discovered in a hundred-year-old scrapbook. Bing seamlessly weaves real and trompe l'oeil reproductions of artifacts-period baseball cards, tickets, advertisements, and a host of other memorabilia into the narrative to present a rich and multifaceted panorama of a bygone era. A book to be pored over by children, treasured by aficionados of the sport-and given as a gift to all ages: a tragi-comic celebration of heroism and of a golden era of sport.<br />

A Caldecott Award Book. Full-color illustrations.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />It took Ludwig Bemelmans years to think of Madeline's next adventure after the 1939 original <I>Madeline</I>, but he did it, and the result was <I>Madeline's Rescue</I>, winner of the 1954 Caldecott Medal. One day on a walk through Paris (a "twelve little girls in two straight lines" kind of walk), Madeline slips and falls off a bridge right into the Seine. Everyone feared she would be dead, "But for a dog / That kept its head," saving her from a "watery grave." What choice do Madeline and the girls have but to take the heroic pooch home, feed her biscuits, milk, and beef, and name her Genevieve? Sadly, when Lord Cucuface gets wind of the new dog, he decrees that no dogs will be allowed in the "old house in Paris that was covered with vines," and kicks Genevieve out on the street.  Madeline vows vengeance, and the girls scour Paris looking for the pup: "They went looking high / and low / And every place a dog might go. / In every place they called her name / But no one answered to the same." As we've come to expect from Bemelmans, all's well that ends well chez Clavel, and young readers will be tickled by this heartwarming, quirky dog story with a surprise finale.

Since it was first published in 1939, Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel has delighted generations of children. Mike and his trusty steam shovel, Mary Anne, dig deep canals for boats to travel through, cut mountain passes for trains, and hollow out cellars for city skyscrapers -- the very symbol of industrial America. But with progress come new machines, and soon the inseparable duo are out of work. Mike believes that Mary Anne can dig as much in a day as one hundred men can dig in a week, and the two have one last chance to prove it and save Mary Anne from the scrap heap. What happens next in the small town of Popperville is a testament to their friendship, and to old-fashioned hard work and ingenuity.</div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Mike Mulligan and his steam shovel Mary Anne make quite a team. The  inseparable duo digs the great canals for the big boats to travel through, cuts through the  large mountains so trains can pass, and hollows out the deep cellars for the great  skyscrapers in the city. But the introduction of gasoline, electric, and diesel shovels  means big trouble for Mike and Mary Anne. No one wants an old-fashioned steam shovel  like Mary Anne when a modern shovel can do the digging in half the time! Forced to  travel far out of the city to look for work, Mike and Mary Anne find themselves in the  little town of Popperville. Mike and Mary Anne make a bid to dig the cellar for the new  town hall, promising the town that if they can't dig the cellar in just one day they'll accept  no payment for the job. Will Mike and Mary Anne be able to complete the job? The  whole town of Popperville turns out to watch. Virginia Lee Burton, author of such classic  children's books as <I>The Little  House</I> and <I>Katy and the  Big Snow,</I> offers a touching portrait of love and dedication while commenting  on the modernization that continuously shapes our lives. Hamilton's wonderful crayon  drawings bring Mike and the indomitable Mary Anne to life. <I>(Ages 3 to 6)</I><br />

After his mother is killed by a hunter, Babar avoids capture by escaping to the city, where he is befriended by the kindly Old Lady. He becomes educated and cultured and, upon his return to the great forest, is crowned King of the Elephants. Translated from Jean de Brunhoff's original French, the adventures of the world's most popular elephant and his friends have enchanted an three generations.  Delightfully amusing illustrations make this short collection of classic Babar tales a book to treasure for children young and old.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br /><I>The Story of Babar</I>--the early adventures of the enduring, endearing elephant--was written in 1931 by French writer Jean de Brunhoff (1899-1937). Since then, it has been translated into at least 12 languages. It's amazing how much can happen to one little elephant in the course of one little book: Babar loses his mother to a hunter, wanders into the city, gets a new wardrobe, becomes the hit of high society, marries his cousin Céleste (totally acceptable in contemporary Elephantine society), and is crowned King of the Elephants.  <P>  <I>The Story of Babar</I> is essentially the tale of a country boy who comes to the city and, while there, comes of age. In the end, he returns home to share his knowledge and experiences with family and friends. The beautiful, delightfully detailed illustrations--de Brunhoff was a painter by trade--never fail to amuse. (Although none of the characters seem to notice, the sight of Babar in a suit leaning against the mantel while he regales his audience with tales of the jungle is plainly hilarious.) All of the Babar books are notable for their ability to tell larger stories with simplicity and style, and <I>The Story of Babar</I> is no exception. Potentially troubling moments--the death of Babar's mother, for example--are handled with taste, emphasizing Babar's unique gift for uncovering a silver lining in the most persistent of clouds. (Ages 4 to 8, though the cursive writing makes it best for reading aloud.)<br />

The performers were out sick, so she had to do everything. She... <BR> <ul type=circle> <li>rode on a unicycle <li>jumped on a trampoline <li>juggled five balls! <li>tamed lions <li>and flew through the air. </ul> <BR> Step into the ring with Olivia, where the lights are dim, the color soft, and a little girl's imagination is the main attraction.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />When it comes time to tell the class what she did on her vacation,  Olivia isn't at all nervous. In fact, she remembers it quite clearly--she went  to the circus, you see. "But when we got there, all the circus people were out  sick with ear infections." What are the odds? But the show must go on!  Fortunately, Olivia jumps right in to help out--riding elephants, posing as the  Tattooed Lady (she draws on the pictures with a marker), taming lions, walking  tightropes, juggling, clowning around, and more. In a marvelous fold-out,  four-panel spread, our porcine heroine even reigns supreme as the Queen of the  Trampoline. "And that's how I saved the circus. And now I am famous." Olivia  looks proud. Her teacher looks mad. Ian Falconer shines in this dryly hilarious  sequel to his 2001 Caldecott Honor Book <I>Olivia</I>. The charcoal and  gouache illustrations perfectly capture Olivia's earnest expressions. Be  prepared to be charmed anew! (Ages 4 to 8) <I>--Karin Snelson</I><br />

But no one excited her as much as Bellini, who walks the clothesline with the grace and ease of a bird. When Mirette discovers that fear has kept him from performing for years, she sets out to show him that sometimes a student can be the greatest teacher of all. Full color.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Mirette and the "Great Bellini" traverse the Paris skyline on high wire in the climactic scene of this picture book about conquering fear. The two meet at Mirette's mother's boarding house, where Bellini is staying with a troupe of traveling performers. Mirette persuades Bellini to teach her his art, and soon enough the two are performing above the rooftops of Paris. While Mirette gets to step outside her daily routine of peeling potatoes and scrubbing floors, Bellini manages to reaffirm his mastery. The story affords a spunky, down-to-earth role model for readers who like to dream big dreams. It also offers rich, scenic portraits of 19th century Paris. The book won the 1993 Caldecott Medal.<br />

Included is an introduction by Dr. Seuss's longtime editor explaining how the book came to be and reproductions of Dr. Seuss's original pencil sketches and hand-printed notes for the book—a true find for all Seuss collectors!  Jack Prelutsky and Lane Smith pay homage to the Good Doctor in their own distinctive ways, the result of which is the union of three one-of-a-kind voices in a brand-new, completely original book that is greater than the sum of its parts. For all of us who will never forget our school days and that special teacher, here is a book to give and to get.  <br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />With the release of <I>Hooray for Diffendoofer Day!</I> readers young and old are afforded a dazzling glimpse into the genius of Theodor "Dr. Seuss" Geisel. The book is based on 14 rough drawings and verses Geisel's secretary gave to the author's editor, Janet Schulman, after his death in 1991. In these scribbled sketches and scratched-out lines, we witness the Seussian process in building a story. When brainstorming the name of what resulted in the Diffendoofer School, he jots down several possible names--"William Wilkins Woofer Junior," "Woodrow Watkins Woofer," "Zoofendorf Elementary," "J. Ebeneezer Bomberg Jr."--all of a slightly different cadence and rhythm, which he tests like a composer writing a new concerto.<p> A small collection of Geisel's rough sketches would be plenty to thrill even the Grinchiest of readers, but there's much more to this marvelous book. Renowned children's poet Jack Prelutsky and award-winning illustrator Lane Smith were called to action by Schulman to pull these sketches into a complete story that would make Dr. Seuss fruffulous with glee. Prelutsky's delicious verse is uncannily Seussian, and it is inexplicably sensational when exploring the Diffendoofer School to discover good old Horton, a platter of green eggs and ham, and a few <I>Whos</I> from <I>Who</I>-ville scattered across the surreal and fascinating landscape of Smith's artwork. Lane and Prelutsky have gone above and beyond the call of duty, maintaining the characters and themes Geisel was just beginning to develop, but enhancing them with their own delightful stylistic stamps.  <p>Above all, this incredible book is an ode to unorthodox, unusually creative teachers, and the innovative thinking they encourage in young minds. (Miss Twining, for example, teaches "how to tell chrysanthemums from miniature poodles.") It is a noble theme, and one that Geisel surely had in mind when he concocted these preliminary sketches. Both new Dr. Seuss aficionados and those who remember <I>The Cat in the Hat</I>'s 1957 debut will cherish this book for its message, artwork, and poetry, and most of all, as a tribute to the man who inspired thousands of readers. <I>(Age 3 and older)</I> <br />

So begins this classic Beginner Book by Dr. Seuss. Beginning with just five fish and continuing into flights of fancy, <i>One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish </i>celebrates how much fun imagination can be. From the can-opening Zans to the boxing Gox to the winking Yink who drinks pink ink, the silly rhymes and colorful cast of characters create an entertaining approach to reading that will have every child giggling from morning to night: “Today is gone. Today was fun. Tomorrow is another one.” <br> <br>Originally created by Dr. Seuss, Beginner Books encourage children to read all by themselves, with simple words and illustrations that give clues to their meaning.<br></p><br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />"Did you ever fly a kite in bed? Did you ever walk with ten cats on your head?" Such are the profound, philosophical queries posed in this well-loved classic by Theodor "Dr. Seuss" Geisel. While many rhymes in this couplet collection resemble sphinx-worthy riddles, Seuss's intention is clear: teach children to read in a way that is both entertaining and educational. It matters little that each wonderful vignette has nothing to do with the one that follows. (We move seamlessly from a one-humped Wump and Mister Gump to yellow pets called the Zeds with one hair upon their heads.) Children today will be as entranced by these ridiculous rhymes as they have been since the book's original publication in 1960--so amused and enchanted, in fact, they may not even notice they are learning to read! <I>(Ages 4 to 8)</I><br />

Or that an ant can lift an object 50 times its weight?  By applying these ratios and proportions to their own bodies, readers will discover what they could do if they had the amazing abilities of animals.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Einstein wondered what it was like to be a beam of light, but the rest of us are happy wondering what it's like to be a flea or a brachiosaurus. David M. Schwartz's engaging picture book is for the rest of us. With the help of James Warhola's colorful, exaggerated illustrations, we learn about the cool things we could do if we were various nonhuman types of creatures. If you high-jumped like a flea, for example, you could jump straight into the Statue of Liberty's torch. If you ate like a shrew, you could devour over 700 hamburgers a day! Each comparison is explained scientifically in a comically illustrated appendix, where young readers will find questions designed to elicit further comparing and calculating. The best surprise by far is finding out what would happen if you grew as fast in your first nine months of life as you did in the nine months before you were born.

The father narrates the words just as Clement Moore wrote them, and artist Jan Brett captures the spirit of the story in glorious illustrations. Visually she extends it for children who will delight in watching two mischievous stowaways from the North Pole enthusiastically exploring the sacks of gifts on the roof. St. Nick, inside the house, is unaware, until the toys spill down onto the lawn -- then he turns with a jerk, and sees them.  Antique toys and exquisite ornaments frame the borders, in which the father, St.Nick, or the family cat and dog can be found watching the action. A unique and beautiful edition, which all the family will cherish for years to come. <br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Whose tiny faces are peeking out from Santa's golden sleigh? Yikes! It's two of Santa's elves who are Christmas Eve stowaways. Beloved illustrator Jan Brett's version of <I>The Night Before Christmas</I> lets these two mischievous elves add their rambunctious spirit to this familiar 1823 rhyming story. Here, Santa and his reindeer land on the snowy roof of a Victorian mansion in New England. While Santa delivers the toys inside, the elves and the reindeer frolic around the lawn, as a pig (earmarked for a girl named Jan) and a few alphabet blocks spill out of sacks into the snow. Santa swiftly reins in the mischief-makers and "away they all flew like the down on a thistle." Brett's richly illustrated borders are lavishly decorated with antique toys, ornaments, and sweet treats, all surrounded with twisting golden ribbons. They also give us a window on the mansion's inhabitants, including the children watching Santa's departure in awe. A sugarplum of a Christmas story, just right for a reading before "a long winter's nap." (Click to see a sample spread.  Illustrations ©1998 by Jan Brett. Published by G.P.

In "an old house in Paris that was covered with  vines," Miss Clavel oversees the education of 12 little girls, the littlest of whom is  the mischievous Madeline. Despite her size, she fearlessly pooh-poohs the tiger in the  zoo and frightens Miss Clavel with her adventurous antics. When she awakens the entire  house with her plaintive cries in the middle of the night, Doctor Cohn whisks the  appendicitis-stricken Madeline off to the hospital where, some two hours later, she  awakens to find a scar on her stomach! The scar (not to mention the flowers, toys, and  candy given to Madeline by her father) proves quite interesting to the rest of Miss  Clavel's charges when they make a special trip to visit her. Ludwig Bemelmans's lilting  rhymes are music to children's ears, and the quirky, oddly perfect drawings of the girls in  "two straight lines" lend an enticing Parisian flavor to this perennial  children's favorite. <I>(Ages 3 to 8)</I><br />

Since it was first published in 1939, Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel has delighted generations of children. Mike and his trusty steam shovel, Mary Anne, dig deep canals for boats to travel through, cut mountain passes for trains, and hollow out cellars for city skyscrapers -- the very symbol of industrial America. But with progress come new machines, and soon the inseparable duo are out of work. Mike believes that Mary Anne can dig as much in a day as one hundred men can dig in a week, and the two have one last chance to prove it and save Mary Anne from the scrap heap. What happens next in the small town of Popperville is a testament to their friendship, and to old-fashioned hard work and ingenuity.</div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Mike Mulligan and his steam shovel Mary Anne make quite a team. The  inseparable duo digs the great canals for the big boats to travel through, cuts through the  large mountains so trains can pass, and hollows out the deep cellars for the great  skyscrapers in the city. But the introduction of gasoline, electric, and diesel shovels  means big trouble for Mike and Mary Anne. No one wants an old-fashioned steam shovel  like Mary Anne when a modern shovel can do the digging in half the time! Forced to  travel far out of the city to look for work, Mike and Mary Anne find themselves in the  little town of Popperville. Mike and Mary Anne make a bid to dig the cellar for the new  town hall, promising the town that if they can't dig the cellar in just one day they'll accept  no payment for the job. Will Mike and Mary Anne be able to complete the job? The  whole town of Popperville turns out to watch. Virginia Lee Burton, author of such classic  children's books as <I>The Little  House</I> and <I>Katy and the  Big Snow,</I> offers a touching portrait of love and dedication while commenting  on the modernization that continuously shapes our lives. Hamilton's wonderful crayon  drawings bring Mike and the indomitable Mary Anne to life. <I>(Ages 3 to 6)</I><br />

Apparently, plenty of others think so, too. First some children ask to join him, then a rabbit, a cat, a dog, a pig, a sheep... Soon,  Mr. Gumpy's boat is precariously full, and there's nowhere for anyone else to go--but overboard! This mild mariner takes everything in stride, though, and his guests are soon bellying up to a nice tea.<p> John Burningham earned the Kate Greenaway Medal, an ALA Notable Children's Book award, and the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award for <I>Mr. Gumpy's Outing</I>, and it's no wonder. This gifted and highly original author-illustrator creates a vision of glorious summer with deeply textured, sometimes only suggested, drawings. His tentatively questioning animals are ready to step right out of the pages and quietly join the delighted reader. And the simple, repetitive dialogue will lull the listener as long as it takes the characters to reach the boat's maximum  capacity. Even then, there's no big splash--just an understated, Burningham-esque "and into the water they fell." Young readers will never tire of this gentle, comforting storybook.

To the harassed farmer's dismay, his communicative cows quickly become contentious:<p> <blockquote> Dear Farmer Brown,<br> The barn is very cold at night. We'd like some electric blankets.<br> Sincerely,<br> The Cows </blockquote><p> When he refuses to comply with their demands, the cows take action. Farmer Brown finds another note on the barn door: "Sorry. We're closed. No milk today." Soon the striking cows and Farmer Brown are forced to reach a mutually agreeable compromise, with the help of an impartial party--the duck. But this poor, beleaguered farmer's "atypical" troubles are not over yet!<p> This hilarious tale will give young rebels-in-the-making a taste of the power of peaceful protest and the satisfaction of cooperative give and take. Witty watercolors by award-winning illustrator Betsy Lewin (<I>Snake Alley Band</I>, <I>Araminta's Paint Box</I>) will make this a favorite for one and all, even if words such as  "ultimatum" and "neutral" throw the younger set.

Between getting stuck in the treetops and being chased by a crocodile, he certainly keeps Babar on his toes, but the king readily admits, “Truly it is not easy to bring up a family, but how nice the babies are!” The fifth Babar story is a wonderful and heartwarming salute to parenthood which every Mom and Dad will appreciate.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />One of Jean de Brunhoff's five original Babar stories, <I>Babar and His Children</I> tells how the royal elephant and Queen Celeste await the birth of their first child... and discover to their surprise that they have three!

Then it's time for young Flora, Pom, and Alexander to get into a series of scrapes and be saved by the bravery and good sense of either their parents or other animals.  Brunhoff's charming, faintly Edwardian illustrations never cease to capture the imagination, and this particular story has something in it for every member of a young family--even if some members of your family are merely human.

Though retired from farmwork for years, Bonny has never been thought of as a pet. But when the farmer is talked into entering her in a pet show, the stage is set for the biggest day of her life. Color illustrations.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />What would inspire ornery old farmer John Skipton to enter his 20-year-old workhorse in a pet show? Why, love, of course. Mr. Skipton has worked hard all his life, so hard in fact that he never had time for marriage, children, or "pets." He was always too busy tending the sheep and the cows or harvesting the fields and orchards. However, as old and gruff as he appears to be, he takes time every day to take a pitchfork full of fresh hay to his two old carthorses, Bonny and Dolly, who've been retired for more than 12 years. After years of pulling ploughs and wagons, and doing all the hard work that tractors do now, the two old horses lead a life of leisure down near the river, quite a steep climb for an old man like Skipton. When the country vet suggests the farmer enter Bonny in the Darrowby Fair Pet Show, Skipton dismisses the idea without consideration.  But over the course of the next week, the old fellow changes his mind and makes a surprise appearance at the pet show. The lovely illustrations depicting the rugged beauty of the Yorkshire dales, the handsome horses, and the lively inhabitants of the community attending the fair bring an old-fashioned beauty to the telling of this charming tale. <I>--Colleen Preston</I><br />

When the two agree to meet one evening in Fitchburg, which is thirty miles away, each decides to get there in his own way and have surprisingly different days.</div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />When Henry and his friend agree to go to Fitchburg to see the country, they each choose very different methods of travel, based on their very different approaches to life. This charming little story illustrates through minimal text and fantastically stylized paintings the concepts Henry David Thoreau spent his life trying out. While Henry (the storybook Henry is a bear) collects flowers to press, strolls on stone walls, finds bird nests, and gathers blackberries, his friend toils and sweats to earn enough money for the train fare to Fitchburg.<p> With subtle nods at Thoreau and his real-life pals Ralph Waldo Emerson and Nathaniel Hawthorne (Henry's friend cleans out Mrs. Thoreau's chicken house, moves the bookcases in Mr. Emerson's study, and pulls weeds in Mr. Hawthorne's garden), D.B. Johnson cleverly introduces young readers to these important historical figures. No moralizing here, just a gentle, humorous look at the different paths each person may choose in life. Johnson chose a passage in Thoreau's <I>Walden</I> (the passage is included in the informative author's note) as inspiration for this delightful picture book, which Thoreau himself would probably be proud to read.

Mr.  Peabody is the beloved elementary school teacher and baseball coach,  who one day finds himself ostracized when rumors spread through the  small town. Mr. Peabody silences the gossip with an unforgettable and  poignant lesson about how we must choose our words carefully to avoid  causing harm to others. <P> Madonna dedicates Mr. Peabody's Apples to teachers everywhere."<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />With <I>Mr. Peabody's Apples</I>, her gorgeous sophomore venture into the realm of children's literature, Madonna sustains her transformation from material girl to mom. Inspired by a 300-year-old Ukrainian story and illustrated by the talented Loren Long, Madonna's tale is about the dangers of gossip. As a frequent target of the rumor mill, who better to teach the young ones about the "power of words" and their potential to cause "harm to others" than the newly reformed diva?<p> Set in a tiny American town, Madonna's story features the big-hearted and much beloved Mr. Peabody, an elementary school teacher and Little League coach who dedicates his summer Saturdays to the local losing team. The kindly teacher seems to savor life the way he savors his weekly apple--taking pleasure in the little things. One weekend after the game, Tommy Tittlebottom watches Mr. Peabody take his apple without paying for it. The following weekend Tommy calls in reinforcements to witness Mr. Peabody's transgression. By the next Saturday, Mr. Peabody's apparent theft has become grist for the Happville rumor mill and no one comes to Little League practice. These moments truly highlight Long's talents as an illustrator--the handsome Mr. Peabody (part Harry Connick Jr., part Robert Redford) comes to life on the page, his disappointment as palpable as that of Billy Little, the young boy who idolizes him. A simple explanation puts the rumors to rest, but as Mr. Peabody points out in a poignant demonstration, small talk can often lead to big trouble for everyone.<p> In a wonderful departure from her debut children's book <I>The English Roses</I>, Madonna has created a tribute to 1940's small-town America that delivers a fundamental message about respecting others. Children will love Mr. Peabody and parents will appreciate the gentle nudge with which he delivers his message. <I>Mr. Peabody's Apples</I> unfolds slowly, but readers young and old will want to linger over each illustrated page lovingly rendered in a muted pallet of rich color. <i>--Daphne Durham</i><br />

And with its spare, rhythmic text and circular tale, <em>If You Give a Mouse a Cookie</em> is perfect for beginning readers and story time!</p><p>If a hungry little mouse shows up on your doorstep, you might want to give him a cookie. And if you give him a cookie, he'll ask for a glass of milk. He'll want to look in a mirror to make sure he doesn't have a milk mustache, and then he'll ask for a pair of scissors to give himself a trim...</p><p>Supports the Common Core State Standards.</p><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Who would ever suspect that a tiny little mouse could wear out an  energetic young boy? Well, if you're going to go around giving an exuberantly bossy rodent a cookie, you'd best be prepared to do one or two more favors for it before your day is through. For example, he'll certainly need a glass of milk to wash down that cookie, won't he? And you can't expect him to drink the milk without a straw, can you? By the time our hero is finished granting all the mouse's very urgent requests--and cleaning up after him--it's no wonder his head is becoming a bit heavy. Laura Joffe Numeroff's tale of warped logic is a sure-fire winner in the giggle-generator category. But concerned parents can rest assured, there's even a little education thrown in for good measure: underneath the folly rest valuable lessons about cause and effect. Felicia Bond's hilarious pictures are full of subtle, fun details. Fans will be happy to know that this dynamic author-illustrator pair teamed up again for <I>If You Give a Moose a Muffin</I> and <I>If You Give a Pig a Pancake</I>.

In this well-loved classic, a little train carrying oodles of toys to all of the good boys and girls is confronted with a towering, seemingly impassable mountain. As nicely as they ask, the toys cannot convince the Shiny New Engine or the Big Strong Engine--far too impressed with themselves--to say anything but "I can not. I can not." It is left up to the Little Blue Engine to overcome insurmountable odds and pull the train to the other side. <I>The Little Engine That Could</I> is an entertaining and inspirational favorite, and the Little Blue Engine's rallying mantra "I think I can--I think I can" will resonate for a lifetime in the head of every child who hears it. <I>(Ages 4 to 8)</I>)<br />

Dr. Seuss) uses humor and rhythm to encourage the very youngest children to discover the joy of reading. A big-eyed boy and a pink-eyed rabbit cavort through the book, seeing everything there is to see: a girl, a horse, an old tin can, the sun, the moon--even pink underpants (which makes them both blush). Rhyming objects give the brief "story" a lilting, happy cadence, and Joe Mathieu's cartoonish colorful pictures provide easy clues to the text. This is a friendly introduction to the wide, wondrous world of seeing and reading.<p> An offspring of the world-famous Beginner Books, Bright and Early Books for Beginning Beginners are designed for an even younger age group. Even preschoolers will be inspired to learn to read with these witty, appealing picture books. (Ages 2 to 5) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I><br />

Rapunzel is an innocent, barefooted beauty with "long blonde hair, as thick and glowing as sunlight or beaten gold." This version of <i>Rapunzel</i> is retold by Barbara Rogasky, who also collaborated with Hyman on <I>The Golem</I>, <I>The Water of Life</I>, and an illustrated collection of poetry for children, <I>Winter Poems</I>. Rogasky's version of this fairy tale flows along in the best of old-fashioned, once-upon-a-time cadences, such as when the prince hears "Rapunzel's sweet, lonely voice singing a song that pierced his heart." As for the witch, Mother Gothel, "she was so feared that even people who had never seen her had nightmares about her."

From a simple log to woven webs of steel, bridges reflect our values, our lifestyles. Feast your eyes on these bridges from around the world, all painstakingly created with intricately cut paper, and you will come to realize that crossing is only one reason for having a bridge.<br />

This noble, whimsical teacher greets her dark, summertime-empty classroom with an explosion of color--a bouquet of fall leaves, a goldfish, rolled-up posters, and shoeboxes full of no-doubt-delightful surprises. Meanwhile, her young students get ready, too: "<B>A</B>dam Krupp wakes up. <B>B</B>renda Heath brushes her teeth. <B>C</B>hristopher Beaker finds his sneaker." Author Joseph Slate matches each animal character with a letter of the alphabet, and readers can flip to the back to discover that Adam is an alligator, Brenda is a beaver, and Christopher is a cat--and so on, through the more obscure animals such as the quokka and the Uakari monkey. Youngsters will relish the scenes of school preparation, adorned by rhyming text: a mother iguana dragging her son Ian Lowe (who cries "I won't go!") out the front door, and the little vole Vicki Densel biting her pencil. And of course Miss Bindergarten is the kindergarten teacher we either remember fondly or wish we had. The final back-to-school classroom scene explodes with love and pride and the smell of freshly sharpened pencils. For kids who adore this book--and there are thousands--don't miss Joseph Slate and Ashley Wolff's second loving tribute to teachers and students,  <I>Miss Bindergarten Celebrates the  100th Day of Kindergarten</I>.

There's a surprise in store, and little ones will want to discover it over and over again. So pull on your sleeping cap and snuggle in for a timeless cumulative tale that's truly like no other. Don and Audrey Wood's beloved picture book has sold more than one and a half million copies. To celebrate its birthday, the original hardcover book now has a fresh new design for both the jacket and interior, and the reproduction of the illustrations has been enhanced to better match the original artwork. A CD is tucked into a sleeve on the inside the front cover. The music, originally produced in 1989, is based on the book and was written and performed by children's musicians Carl and Jennifer Shaylen. The CD begins with a reading of the story and follows with six original songs that are just as fun, jaunty, and sweet as the book itself.</div><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br /><I>There is a house,<br> a napping house,<br> where everyone is sleeping.</I><p> "Everyone," in this case is a snoring granny, a dreaming child, a dozing dog, a  snoozing cat, a slumbering mouse... and a wakeful flea! Uh-oh. Looks like the  napping house won't be napping for long. With their very own brand of humor,  Audrey Wood and Don Wood create an appealing bedtime book compatible with  Margaret Wise Brown's classic <I>Goodnight Moon</I>. This small,  square board book, with its rhythmic, repetitive text and witty pictures in  shades of ever-brightening blues and greens (as the night turns to day), is sure  to be a winner with preschool insomniacs. The sleepy household congregates on  Granny's bed, slowly building a very relaxed pile of bodies in shifting  positions. Young readers will enjoy tracking the critters as they make their  way, one by one, to the bed--and then guessing what will happen when the wakeful  flea joins the heap. Be sure to look for this author-illustrator team's other  hilarious collaborative efforts, including <I>Piggies</I> and <I>Silly Sally</I>. (Baby to  preschool) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I><br />

People of all ages have terrible, horrible days, and  Alexander offers us the cranky commiseration we crave as well as a  reminder that things may not be all that bad. As Alexander's day  progresses, he faces a barrage of bummers worthy of a country- western song: getting smushed in the middle seat of the car, a  dessertless lunch sack, a cavity at the dentist's office,  stripeless sneakers, witnessing kissing on television, and being  forced to sleep in railroad-train pajamas. He resolves several  times to move to Australia. <P> Judith Viorst flawlessly and humorously captures a child's testy  temperament, rendering Alexander sympathetic rather than whiny.  Our hero's gum-styled hair and peevish countenance are artfully  depicted by Ray Cruz's illustrations. An ALA Notable Book,  <i>Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day</i>  is a great antidote to bad days everywhere, sure to put a smile on  even the crabbiest of faces. <I>(Ages 5 to 9)</I><br />

Such as a walk in the woods late at night. Jane Yolen captures this wonderment in a book whose charm rises from its simplicity. "It was late one winter night, long past my bedtime, when Pa and I went owling." The two walked through the woods with nothing but hope and each other in a journey that will fascinate many a child.

A perfect keepsake for any family, this beautiful edition can be handed down to each new generation of readers.</p>  <p>In 1986 The Polar Express was awarded the prestigious Caldecott Medal and hit the New York Times bestseller list. Since that time, more than six and a half million copies have been sold, and every December it faithfully reappears on national bestseller lists. In 2004, The Polar Express became a blockbuster holiday movie. The DVD release in 2005 assures, that like the book, the movie will become a holiday classic.</p><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br /><div class="aplus">  <p>One couldn't select a more delightful and exciting premise for a children's book than the tale of a young boy lying awake on Christmas Eve only to have Santa Claus sweep by and take him on a trip with other children to the North Pole. And one couldn't ask for a more talented artist and writer to tell the story than Chris Van Allsburg. Allsburg, a sculptor who entered the genre nonchalantly when he created a children's book as a diversion from his sculpting, won the 1986 Caldecott Medal for this book, one of several award winners he's produced. <b>The Polar Express</b> rings with vitality and wonder.</p> <p align="left">  <hr class="bucketDivider" size="1" /> <br/> <h4><B>Amazon Exclusive: A Letter from Chris Van Allsburg</B></h4>  <img align="right" border="0" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/VanAllsburg200.jpg"/>  <p>Dear Amazon Readers,</p>  <p>Over the past twenty-five years, many people have shared stories with me about the effect that reading <i>The Polar Express</i> has had on their families and on their celebration of Christmas.</p>  <p>One of the most poignant was told to me five or six years ago at a book signing in the Midwest, on a snowy December evening.  As I inscribed a book to a woman in her sixties, she told me that it was the second copy she had owned, and wanted to know if she could she tell me what had happened to the first.  "Of course," I answered.</p>  <p>A dozen years earlier the woman, who had no children of her own, befriended a neighbor, a boy of about seven, named Eddie.  He would often cross his driveway to visit her.</p>  <p>She had a collection of picture books, which she read to him, but around the holidays, the only story he ever wanted to hear, over and over, was <i>The Polar Express</i>.  One year she offered to give him the book, but Eddie declined because he wanted to hear her read it aloud to him, which she continued to do every year until the boy and his family moved away.</p>  <p>Years later the woman learned from a mutual acquaintance that Eddie had grown up and become a soldier. He was stationed in Iraq. Since Christmas was approaching, the woman decided to send him a gift box. She included candy, cookies, socks, and her old copy of <i>The Polar Express</i>. She wasn't sure what a nineteen-year-old battle-weary soldier would do with the book in an army barracks in the Middle East, but she wanted him to have it. A month later, after the holidays had passed, she received a letter from Eddie.</p>  <p>He told her he was very happy to have heard from her and to get the box of gifts.  He had opened it in his barracks, just before curfew, with some of his fellow GIs already in their bunks. A soldier in the next bunk spotted the book. He knew it well from his own childhood and asked Eddie to read it. "Out loud?" he asked. "Yeah," his buddy told him.</p>  <p>Eddie, quietly and a little self-consciously, read <i>The Polar Express</i>. When he'd finished and closed the book, a moment of silence passed. Then from behind him a voice called out, "Read it again," and another joined in, "Yeah, read it again," and a third added, "This time, louder." So Eddie did. </p>  <p>He wrote to the woman that he'd stood up and read it to his comrades just the way he remembered she had read it to him. </p>  <p>All aboard,</p> <i>Chris Van Allsburg</i><br/> </p> <br/> <hr class="bucketDivider" size="1" /> <br/> <p align="left">  <h4>Recipes and Activities to Celebrate the 25th Anniversary of <i>The Polar Express</i></h4> <br> <b>(Click on Images for the Recipe or Activity [PDF])</b> <br> </p>  <b>Snacks for Santa</b>  <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1"  cellpadding="1">                      <tr align="center" valign="top">                                 <th width="25%">                                    <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/XmasTreeTruck250.jpg" border="0">                                                                                                    <br/>                                 Candy Cane Sugar Cookies                                    </th>                                 <td width="25%">                   <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/SantaAndBoy250.jpg"  border="0">                                                                                                   <br/> Polar Chocolate Nougat Caramel Squares                                                                                                   <br/>                                  </td>                                     <td width="25%">                                   <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/PolarExpress250.jpg"  border="0">                                                                                                   <br/>                 Christmas Snowball Cookies                                                                                  </td>                       </tr>  </table><br/><br/> <b>Fun and Games</b> <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1"  cellpadding="1">                  <tr align="center" valign="top">                                    <th width="25%">                                                                    <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/SantasSleigh250.jpg"  border="0">                                                                                                   <br/>                                                 A <i>Polar Express</i> Word Search                                                                                   </th>                                 <td width="25%">                                                                                                    <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/BoyAtDoor250.jpg" border="0">                                                                                                    <br/>                                                 A <i>Polar Express</i> Crossword                                                                                  </td>                                 <td width="25%">                                                                                                    <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/JingleBell250.jpg" border="0">                                                                                                    <br/>                                                  A <i>Polar Express</i> Maze                                                                                  </td>                 </tr>  </table>  <br/> <hr class="bucketDivider" size="1" /> <br/>  </div><br />

The reader is invited to guess the thief.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Reading <I>The Eleventh Hour</I> is like running a marathon: one finishes exhausted but satisfied. Graeme Base, creator of the popular <I>Animalia</I>, has crafted another intricately wrought, gorgeously illustrated picture book, this time a mystery in verse. When Horace the Elephant decides to throw himself a party for his 11th birthday, he never suspects a crime will be committed by lunchtime. Who has stolen the birthday feast? As with any good mystery, everyone is guilty until proven innocent. The proof lies in the myriad clues embedded in each glorious illustration. Young sleuths will delight in decoding the complex messages that pop up in unexpected places.<p> Graeme Base used the buildings he saw during his travels through Africa, Asia, and Europe to design and decorate Horace's fantastic house. Astute readers may recognize Roman cathedrals, Scottish palaces, and stone carvings from India. Best of all, secreted in these walls are cryptic messages in Egyptian hieroglyphics, anagrams, and even Morse code to challenge the perceptive and deductive abilities of any reader "of tender years or long in tooth." <I>The Eleventh Hour</I> is a brilliant, rigorous, creative romp that no child (or adult) should miss. <I>(All Ages)</I><br />

He asks his brother, Bob, to take care of the animals. "But keep an eye on Duck. He's trouble."</I> <BR> Bob follows the instructions in Farmer Brown's notes exactly. He orders pizza with anchovies for the hens, bathes the pigs with bubble bath, and lets the cows choose a movie. <BR> Is that giggling he hears? <BR> <I>Giggle, giggle,<BR> quack, giggle, moo,<BR> giggle, oink...</I> <BR> The duck, the cows, the hens, and the pigs are back in top form in this hilarious follow-up to the beloved Caldecott Honor Book <I>Click, Clack, Moo: Cows That Type.</I><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />The crafty barnyard crew from <I>Click, Clack, Moo: Cows That  Type</I> is back, and this time Farmer Brown has decided to take a vacation.  But not to worry--he's leaving his brother Bob to mind the farm: "I wrote  everything down for you. Just follow my instructions and everything will be  fine. But keep an eye on Duck. He's trouble." Of course, fans of Doreen Cronin  and Betsy Lewin's last brilliant book already know to keep an eye on that  manipulative mallard. Now, wait a minute... what's Duck doing eyeing that  pencil?<p> Poor Bob has no idea what he's in for, and Duck and friends have shrewdly seized  this chance to move on from collective bargaining to outright subterfuge: "Bob  gave Duck a good long stare and went inside. He read the first note: 'Tuesday  night is pizza night (not the frozen kind!). The hens prefer anchovies.'" Well,  seems like strange way to run a farm, but... "Twenty-nine minutes later there  was hot pizza in the barn." Giggle, giggle, quack, indeed.<p> Clearly, Duck and his cow pals aren't the only ones around to have mastered the  pencil and the keyboard. Cronin and Lewin have put their talents to good use yet  again, offering up another simple but clever story fit for kids and grownups  alike. Lewin seems to snicker throughout her playful watercolors (gotta love  those monogrammed towels: "FB"), and Cronin has a ball with the animal cast and  their human patsy. (What do the cows pick on movie night? "The Sound of Moosic,"  of course. Giggle, giggle, moo.) (Ages 4 to 8) <I>--Paul Hughes</I><br />

If you give him a muffin, he'll want some jam to go with it. When he's eaten all your muffins, he'll want to go to the store to get some more muffin mix. <p> In this hilarious sequel to <em> If You Give a Mouse a Cookie,</em> the young host is again run ragged by a surprise guest. Young readers will delight in the comic complications that follow when a little boy entertains a gregarious moose.</p><br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />"If you give a moose a muffin, he'll want some jam to go with it." So begins the most logical silliness to be found anywhere--at least since Laura Joffe Numeroff and illustrator Felicia Bond's <I>If You Give a Mouse a Cookie</I>. Readers will follow a young boy and his voracious visitor through a series of antlered antics: jam reveries and puppet shows and big messes. It all makes perfect sense, really, once you stop to think about it. What moose <I>wouldn't</I> want to borrow a sweater when it's cold outside? And why shouldn't the loose button on the sweater remind him of his grandmother? Bond's cleverly detailed, witty illustrations perfectly complement Numeroff's deadpan style. Through just a few deft words and brush strokes, the reader gets a real sense of the unique personalities of the two characters. Children will relate easily to the full-circle reasoning of the story, while picking up the concept of cause and effect. The moral of the story? Keep plenty of muffin mix and blackberry jam in your cupboard. You never know <I>who</I> may drop by. (Great read aloud, ages 4 to 8) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I><br />

But adolescence brought questions. Cracks began to appear in the Iron Curtain, and news from the West slowly filtered into the country. Sís learned about beat poetry, rock ’n’ roll, blue jeans, and Coca-Cola. He let his hair grow long, secretly read banned books, and joined a rock band. Then came the Prague Spring of 1968, and for a teenager who wanted to see the world and meet the Beatles, this was a magical time. It was short-lived, however, brought to a sudden and brutal end by the Soviet-led invasion. But this brief flowering had provided a glimpse of new possibilities—creativity could be discouraged but not easily killed. <BR> <BR>By joining memory and history, Sís takes us on his extraordinary journey: from infant with paintbrush in hand to young man borne aloft by the wings of his art.</DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><DIV><DIV><I>The Wall</I> is a 2007 New York Times Book Review Best Illustrated Book of the Year, a 2008 Caldecott Honor Book, a 2008 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year, the winner of the 2008 Boston Globe - Horn Book Award for Nonfiction, and a nominee for the 2008 Eisner Award for Best Publication for Kids.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><br />

This noble, whimsical teacher greets her dark, summertime-empty classroom with an explosion of color--a bouquet of fall leaves, a goldfish, rolled-up posters, and shoeboxes full of no-doubt-delightful surprises. Meanwhile, her young students get ready, too: "<B>A</B>dam Krupp wakes up. <B>B</B>renda Heath brushes her teeth. <B>C</B>hristopher Beaker finds his sneaker." Author Joseph Slate matches each animal character with a letter of the alphabet, and readers can flip to the back to discover that Adam is an alligator, Brenda is a beaver, and Christopher is a cat--and so on, through the more obscure animals such as the quokka and the Uakari monkey. Youngsters will relish the scenes of school preparation, adorned by rhyming text: a mother iguana dragging her son Ian Lowe (who cries "I won't go!") out the front door, and the little vole Vicki Densel biting her pencil. And of course Miss Bindergarten is the kindergarten teacher we either remember fondly or wish we had. The final back-to-school classroom scene explodes with love and pride and the smell of freshly sharpened pencils. For kids who adore this book--and there are thousands--don't miss Joseph Slate and Ashley Wolff's second loving tribute to teachers and students,  <I>Miss Bindergarten Celebrates the  100th Day of Kindergarten</I>.

Do you think the Pigeon is happy about that?<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br /><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month for Kids, April 2012</strong>: The Pigeon is back (hooray!) and this time the drama centers on an adorable little duckling who gets a cookie just by asking--<i>politely</i>.  Just by asking?! <i> Politely</i>  reminds the duckling, but the Pigeon is already off on a hilarious rant about all the things he asks for--many of which readers of the earlier Pigeon books will remember--ending with the all-too-familiar refrain, “It’s not fair.”  Author Mo Willems adds a new twist to this Pigeon story by juxtaposing Pigeon’s familiar high volume theatrics with the calm simplicity of a soft-spoken duckling.  As a parent, I appreciate the book’s message about the power of politeness and the rewards of sharing (warning: cookies are involved), yet the story never loses the jovial, high-spirited quality that makes the Pigeon books so popular with kids and the adults who read to them. <i>--Seira Wilson</i> <br/> <hr class="bucketDivider" size="1" /> <br /> <p align="left"><strong class="h1">Amazon Exclusive: The Pigeon: A Life in Pictures</strong><br /> <strong>(Click on images to enlarge)</strong></p> <p> <table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody> <tr align="center" class="tiny" valign="top"> <td width="25%"> <img border="0" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/Disney/AMAZON.MO.1_200._V134763753_.jpg" /> </td> <td width="25%"> <img border="0" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/Disney/AMAZON.MO.2_200._V134763753_.jpg" /></td> <td width="25%"> <img border="0" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/Disney/AMAZON.MO.3_200._V134763748_.jpg" /></td> </tr> <tr align="center" class="tiny" valign="top"> <td width="25%">Back in 1993, I was cartooning for a ’zine.

To mollify him, I put him in that year’s sketchbook.</td> <td width="25%">The original sketchbook was much longer than the final published volume, but some of the lines were the same.</td> </tr> <tr align="center" class="tiny" valign="top"> <td width="25%"> <img border="0" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/Disney/AMAZON.MO.4_200._V134763751_.jpg" /></td> <td width="25%"> <img border="0" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/Disney/AMAZON.MO.5_200._V134763752_.jpg" /></td> <td width="25%"> <img border="0" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/Disney/Pigeon_bus._V134974933_.jpg" /></td> </tr> <tr align="center" class="tiny" valign="top"> <td width="25%">In late 1999, an agent essentially agreed with the Pigeon and rejected my picture book ideas. She suggested I revisit my sketchbook with an eye to turning it into a picture book. My wife was working at a school library at the time and had read the sketchbook to her kids, who had enjoyed it. So I suppose it wasn’t too crazy an idea. I started to revise the layout and work with color.</td> <td width="25%">At the end of 2001, after several dozen rejections because the book was “unusual,” an editor decided that “unusual” was a good thing. Plus, it made her laugh. I began reworking and rewriting. The Pigeon was now starting to look more like his mature self.</td> <td width="25%">Don’t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus! was published in April 2003 and, to my surprise, proved to be popular quite quickly. Thankfully, that Pigeon doodle in the notebook back in 1997 was so insistent. He was right!</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br /></p> <hr class="bucketDivider" noshade="noshade" size="1="/"" /><br />

A perfect keepsake for any family, this beautiful edition can be handed down to each new generation of readers.</p>  <p>In 1986 The Polar Express was awarded the prestigious Caldecott Medal and hit the New York Times bestseller list. Since that time, more than six and a half million copies have been sold, and every December it faithfully reappears on national bestseller lists.

And one couldn't ask for a more talented artist and writer to tell the story than Chris Van Allsburg. Allsburg, a sculptor who entered the genre nonchalantly when he created a children's book as a diversion from his sculpting, won the 1986 Caldecott Medal for this book, one of several award winners he's produced. <b>The Polar Express</b> rings with vitality and wonder.</p> <p align="left">  <hr class="bucketDivider" size="1" /> <br/> <h4><B>Amazon Exclusive: A Letter from Chris Van Allsburg</B></h4>  <img align="right" border="0" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/VanAllsburg200.jpg"/>  <p>Dear Amazon Readers,</p>  <p>Over the past twenty-five years, many people have shared stories with me about the effect that reading <i>The Polar Express</i> has had on their families and on their celebration of Christmas.</p>  <p>One of the most poignant was told to me five or six years ago at a book signing in the Midwest, on a snowy December evening.  As I inscribed a book to a woman in her sixties, she told me that it was the second copy she had owned, and wanted to know if she could she tell me what had happened to the first.  "Of course," I answered.</p>  <p>A dozen years earlier the woman, who had no children of her own, befriended a neighbor, a boy of about seven, named Eddie.  He would often cross his driveway to visit her.</p>  <p>She had a collection of picture books, which she read to him, but around the holidays, the only story he ever wanted to hear, over and over, was <i>The Polar Express</i>.  One year she offered to give him the book, but Eddie declined because he wanted to hear her read it aloud to him, which she continued to do every year until the boy and his family moved away.</p>  <p>Years later the woman learned from a mutual acquaintance that Eddie had grown up and become a soldier. He was stationed in Iraq. Since Christmas was approaching, the woman decided to send him a gift box. She included candy, cookies, socks, and her old copy of <i>The Polar Express</i>. She wasn't sure what a nineteen-year-old battle-weary soldier would do with the book in an army barracks in the Middle East, but she wanted him to have it. A month later, after the holidays had passed, she received a letter from Eddie.</p>  <p>He told her he was very happy to have heard from her and to get the box of gifts.  He had opened it in his barracks, just before curfew, with some of his fellow GIs already in their bunks. A soldier in the next bunk spotted the book. He knew it well from his own childhood and asked Eddie to read it. "Out loud?" he asked. "Yeah," his buddy told him.</p>  <p>Eddie, quietly and a little self-consciously, read <i>The Polar Express</i>. When he'd finished and closed the book, a moment of silence passed. Then from behind him a voice called out, "Read it again," and another joined in, "Yeah, read it again," and a third added, "This time, louder." So Eddie did. </p>  <p>He wrote to the woman that he'd stood up and read it to his comrades just the way he remembered she had read it to him. </p>  <p>All aboard,</p> <i>Chris Van Allsburg</i><br/> </p> <br/> <hr class="bucketDivider" size="1" /> <br/> <p align="left">  <h4>Recipes and Activities to Celebrate the 25th Anniversary of <i>The Polar Express</i></h4> <br> <b>(Click on Images for the Recipe or Activity [PDF])</b> <br> </p>  <b>Snacks for Santa</b>  <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1"  cellpadding="1">                      <tr align="center" valign="top">                                 <th width="25%">                                    <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/XmasTreeTruck250.jpg" border="0">                                                                                                    <br/>                                 Candy Cane Sugar Cookies                                    </th>                                 <td width="25%">                   <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/SantaAndBoy250.jpg"  border="0">                                                                                                   <br/> Polar Chocolate Nougat Caramel Squares                                                                                                   <br/>                                  </td>                                     <td width="25%">                                   <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/PolarExpress250.jpg"  border="0">                                                                                                   <br/>                 Christmas Snowball Cookies                                                                                  </td>                       </tr>  </table><br/><br/> <b>Fun and Games</b> <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1"  cellpadding="1">                  <tr align="center" valign="top">                                    <th width="25%">                                                                    <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/SantasSleigh250.jpg"  border="0">                                                                                                   <br/>                                                 A <i>Polar Express</i> Word Search                                                                                   </th>                                 <td width="25%">                                                                                                    <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/BoyAtDoor250.jpg" border="0">                                                                                                    <br/>                                                 A <i>Polar Express</i> Crossword                                                                                  </td>                                 <td width="25%">                                                                                                    <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/hmh-ems/JingleBell250.jpg" border="0">                                                                                                    <br/>                                                  A <i>Polar Express</i> Maze                                                                                  </td>                 </tr>  </table>  <br/> <hr class="bucketDivider" size="1" /> <br/>  </div><br />

Now the tradition continues in a new All Aboard Book, with gem-like illustrations capturing all the magic of this special season. Full color.<br /><strong>Amazon.com Review</strong><br />Whose tiny faces are peeking out from Santa's golden sleigh? Yikes! It's two of Santa's elves who are Christmas Eve stowaways. Beloved illustrator Jan Brett's version of <I>The Night Before Christmas</I> lets these two mischievous elves add their rambunctious spirit to this familiar 1823 rhyming story. Here, Santa and his reindeer land on the snowy roof of a Victorian mansion in New England. While Santa delivers the toys inside, the elves and the reindeer frolic around the lawn, as a pig (earmarked for a girl named Jan) and a few alphabet blocks spill out of sacks into the snow. Santa swiftly reins in the mischief-makers and "away they all flew like the down on a thistle." Brett's richly illustrated borders are lavishly decorated with antique toys, ornaments, and sweet treats, all surrounded with twisting golden ribbons. They also give us a window on the mansion's inhabitants, including the children watching Santa's departure in awe. A sugarplum of a Christmas story, just right for a reading before "a long winter's nap." (Click to see a sample spread.  Illustrations ©1998 by Jan Brett. Published by G.P. Putnam's Sons, a division of Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.) (Ages 3 to 6) <I>--Marcie Bovetz</I> <br />
